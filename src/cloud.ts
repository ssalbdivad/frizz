/**
 * `frizz up` — one command for "start the server and reach it from anywhere".
 *
 * Before this, reaching a board from a phone meant two terminals and three flags: a launch with
 * `--public-origin https://…`, a separate `cloudflared tunnel … run …` in another window, and
 * remembering that closing either one silently breaks the phone. Nothing about that is discoverable,
 * and getting it wrong produces either "Forbidden" or a Cloudflare error with no hint which half died.
 *
 * So the tunnel becomes a supervised CHILD of the board. One process to start, one to stop, and the two
 * halves cannot drift out of sync because they share a lifetime.
 *
 * Deliberately does NOT ask about the port. There is a default, and `FRIZZ_PORT` overrides it for the
 * few people who care — a prompt for it would be a question almost nobody has an answer to.
 *
 * Three ways to have a hostname, told apart by the shape of the answer:
 *
 *   (empty)            -> CLAIM a private unguessable name on frizz.sh — no account, no sign-in
 *   colin              -> CLAIM `colin.frizz.sh` from the registrar, bound to your GitHub account
 *                         through a no-permission GitHub sign-in (github-device-flow.ts)
 *   board.example.com  -> a tunnel you made yourself, which Frizz only runs
 *
 * The claimed path exists because creating a tunnel and its DNS record needs a zone-scoped Cloudflare
 * token, and that token can never live on a user's machine. The registrar holds it and hands back a
 * per-tunnel run token, which runs exactly one tunnel and can reach nothing else in the zone.
