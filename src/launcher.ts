Usage: ${command} [options]

Run it in the directory you want to work in. One server serves EVERY project on this machine,
each on its own board, so a second run joins the one already going. Frizz serves a
verified immutable artifact, selecting or safely building one on first launch, then opens it in
your default browser; source edits never restart the shared board.

Options:
  --no-app               print the URL without opening a browser
  --foreground           accepted for compatibility; ${command} always runs in the foreground
  --dev                  explicitly use the unsafe source watcher and Vite/HMR, not an artifact
  --port <port>          request a fixed port for a new workspace server
  --sandbox              a disposable Frizz to try things in: throwaway home and project, its
                         own port, deleted when this terminal closes; credentials (gh,
                         cloudflared, Claude, Codex, the machine's frizz.sh key) are shared
  --link                 print a fresh single-use access link for the already-running board
  --sessions             list the devices holding a session on the already-running board
  --sign-out <id|all>    revoke one device's session, or every one of them
  --debug                stream the full event feed to the terminal instead of the compact readout
  --status               report this workspace's stable server and artifact
  --stop                 stop this workspace's UI supervisor (agents keep running)
  -h, --help             show this help


Commands:
  build                  build a new immutable candidate from the configured Frizz source checkout
  promote <digest>       explicitly select a verified candidate for this workspace
  restart                restart the currently promoted artifact without building
  top                    memory on this machine and Frizz's share of it (--json, --watch)

To reach the board from a phone or another machine, press R in the terminal running it: a short
walkthrough sets up a private frizz.sh name (no account needed), a custom one, a Cloudflare
Tunnel, Tailscale, or a proxy of your own, and
remembers the choice, so a plain launch serves it from then on. The board stays on loopback and
shows a single-use sign-in link as a QR; press L for a fresh one, or run --link from another shell.

An immutable artifact is the default. --dev is the only explicit unsafe source watcher/HMR mode.

/**
 * What a `frizz` in THIS directory should actually do.
 *
 * RUNNING FRIZZ IN A REPOSITORY OPENS THAT REPOSITORY, minting `.frizz/.id` on the spot if it has
 * none. That is the whole command: `cd` somewhere and run it, and the board you get is the board for
 * where you are. Making adoption a confirmation step instead broke exactly that — running it in a new
 * checkout hosted on some OTHER project and landed on the project grid, so the maintainer's `frizz-dev` in
 * `ccbroker` opened `frizz` (2026-08-11).
 *
 * What that confirmation step was actually protecting against is narrower, and both halves survive
 * here. $HOME is never adopted, because minting an id there writes a project into Frizz's own global
 * state root and every unmarked directory under home then resolves to it (see isHomeDirectory). And a
 * directory with no marker of its own — `~/Downloads`, a scratch folder, a typo — is a command in the
 * wrong terminal, not a project, so it is still only OFFERED. A repository is neither of those.
 *
 *  - `open`  — a directory Frizz knows, or one that IS a project (hasProjectMarker): its own board.
 *  - `offer` — an unmarked, unadopted directory: open `/` and let the add-project dialog ask. Nothing
 *                is written.
 *  - `everything` — $HOME, which is never offered at all, because there is no version of this the
 *                operator wants: it opens Everything, `/`, and nothing more.
 *
 * The last two still need a project to LAUNCH with, because a server is a process that has to serve
 * something; the most recently opened registered project is that host. With an empty registry there
 * is nothing to host and nothing to show, so the caller is told to adopt explicitly.
