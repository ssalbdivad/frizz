/**

 * every exit path. Two panes each doing that would fight over stdin and race to restore it. So the
 * host holds raw mode alone, routes keys — to the open pane while one is open, otherwise to whatever
 * pane the key is bound to — and re-raises ^C by hand, because raw mode stops the TTY doing it.
 *
 * TTY only. Under a pipe, CI, or `--debug` there is no keyboard and no cursor addressing, so the host
 * does not install and the plain records path is untouched.
