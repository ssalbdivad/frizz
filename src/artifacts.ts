 * carries a `.gitignore` of `*` on purpose, the `.venv/.gitignore` trick that keeps this scratch
 * tree out of any repo a user happens to init above it (see project-root.ts). Tailwind v4 finds its
 * class names by SCANNING the source tree, and its scanner honours ancestor `.gitignore` files, so
 * that one `*` makes every `.tsx` in the snapshot invisible to it. Nothing fails: Vite exits 0, the
 * bundle is complete, and the emitted CSS still holds `@theme` variables, imported stylesheets and
 * every hand-written component rule — just not one utility class. The app is entirely Tailwind, so
 * the whole UI renders unstyled.
 *
 * Measured on 4.3.2, one variable, same tree: 114,660 bytes at a neutral path, 28,849 under
 * `~/.frizz`, 114,660 again with the ancestor `.gitignore` moved aside.
 *
 * An empty `.git` DIRECTORY is enough — the scanner treats a directory holding one as a repository
 * root and stops walking up for ignore files, which restores auto-detection to byte-identical output
 * (verified: same content hash as a build at a neutral path). It is deliberately not a real `git
 * init`: with no `HEAD` inside, git's own discovery does not accept it as a repository and keeps
 * walking up exactly as it does today, so no build step can mistake the snapshot for a checkout and
 * read a revision out of it. It also needs no subprocess, and cannot fire a user's init templates or
 * hooks.
 *
 * `@source` does not substitute for this. The directory form is filtered by the same ignore rules
 * (28,849 bytes, unchanged); the glob form does bypass them but only covers what it is spelled to
 * cover, and re-deriving Tailwind's own auto-detection by hand got 46,190 of the 114,660 bytes.
