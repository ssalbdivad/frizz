Run it in the directory you want to work in. One server serves EVERY project on this machine,
all on one page, so a second run joins the one already going. Runs the
npm-resolved immutable Frizz package, then opens it in your default browser. Use frizz-dev only
for a source checkout.

Options:
  --no-app               print the URL without opening a browser
  --port <port>          request a fixed port for a new workspace server
  --sandbox              a disposable Frizz to try things in: throwaway home and project, its
                         own port, deleted when this terminal closes; credentials (gh,
                         cloudflared, Claude, Codex, the machine's frizz.sh key) are shared
  --link                 print a fresh single-use access link for the running board
  --sessions             list the devices signed in to the running board
  --sign-out <id|all>    sign one device out, or every one of them
  --status               report the board running for this project: address, pid, version
  --stop                 stop the board running for this project (running agents keep going)
  --debug                stream the full event feed to the terminal instead of the compact readout
  -h, --help             show this help


To reach the board from a phone or another machine, press R in the terminal running it: a short
walkthrough sets up a private frizz.sh name (no account needed), a custom one, a Cloudflare
Tunnel, Tailscale, or a proxy of your own, and
remembers the choice, so a plain launch serves it from then on. The board stays on loopback and
shows a single-use sign-in link as a QR; press L for a fresh one, or run --link from another shell.`,
