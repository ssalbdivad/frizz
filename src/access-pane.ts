 * Why a pane and not a line in the readout: the readout is SCROLLBACK. A QR that lives there is the
 * same leak as a standing secret, just harder to grep for, and it would still be on screen long after
 * the code behind it expired. A pane shows a credential for as long as someone is looking at it and
 * then takes it away.
 *
 * The keyboard itself — raw mode, ^C, restoring the shell — belongs to the pane host (pane-host.ts),
 * which routes L here and R to the remote-access pane. This file only knows how to paint a link.
