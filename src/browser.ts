// ---- Chromium app-shim (macOS Dock identity) ----
//
// All of this is empirically verified on macOS + Chrome 150 (2026-07). The interesting findings:
//  · The CDP `PWA` domain (PWA.install / PWA.changeAppUserSettings / …) is only exposed to clients
//    with AllowUnsafeOperations() — which is true for --remote-debugging-pipe connections and FALSE
//    for --remote-debugging-port websockets (chrome_devtools_session.cc gates the handler). So: pipe.
//  · PWA.install(manifestId, installUrl) generates the shim bundle, but defaults the app's *user
//    display mode* to "open in a browser tab" — launching then answers the shim kSuccessAndDisconnect
//    (no host) and the window stays Chrome-branded. PWA.changeAppUserSettings(displayMode:
//    "standalone") is the missing half; after it the shim hosts the window under its own identity.
//  · Chrome's generated app id is NOT reproducible as crx-id(SHA-256(start_url)) (tried; mismatch),
//    so we never compute ids — the shim's Info.plist (CrAppModeShortcutURL / CrAppModeUserDataDir /
//    CrAppModeShortcutID) is the source of truth for detection.
//  · Bundle NAME: the .app filename and CFBundleName are both the manifest `name` — but only for the
//    FIRST bundle of that name. Chrome disambiguates a collision by appending " 1", " 2", … and
//    collisions are routine here, since manifestIdFor is origin-scoped and every project runs on its
//    own port (verified on a real machine: Frizz.app/4917, Frizz 1.app/4918, Frizz 2.app/4920,
//    Frizz 3.app/4921). EXPECTED_BUNDLE_NAME must therefore track
//    packages/web/public/manifest.webmanifest `name`, and the comparison must tolerate that numeric
//    suffix — see bundleNameMatchesManifest. findAppShim matches on URL + data-dir (NOT name), so a
//    bundle installed under an old name keeps launching under it forever; a name that is neither the
//    manifest name nor one of its numbered siblings is a STALE shim and is reinstalled (self-heals a
//    manifest rename).
//  · SUCCESS SENTINEL: PWA.install and the standalone flip are two separate CDP calls; if install
//    lands but the flip doesn't, the bundle exists in open-in-a-tab mode and would brand every
//    window as Chrome forever (findAppShim would keep matching it). So after — and only after —
//    changeAppUserSettings(standalone) succeeds we drop a `<dataPath>/.frizz-pwa-standalone` marker.
//    A found shim is trusted only if that marker exists; a shim without it is a POISONED partial
//    install and is reinstalled (see ensureAppShim). Both staleness conditions share one heal path.
//  · FIRST-RUN seeding: a shim launch boots Chrome ITSELF, so our --no-first-run/--no-default-
//    browser-check flags never apply — a freshly-installed profile (the CDP install writes NO "First
//    Run" sentinel) shows the "Welcome to Chrome"/make-default UI on the first shim launch. We seed
//    the "First Run" sentinel (and additively turn off the default-browser check) into the profile at
//    launch time so shim boots are clean; this also self-heals profiles installed before this fix.

// NOTE (fragility): this hard-codes Chrome's macOS shim directory. Chrome writes generated app
// bundles to "~/Applications/Chrome Apps.localized" — an undocumented, product-name-derived path.
// A Chromium channel/fork with a different app-shortcuts dir (or a future Chrome rename) silently
// breaks detection here; ensureAppShim then always reinstalls / falls back to plain --app.
const CHROME_APPS_DIR = join(homedir(), "Applications", "Chrome Apps.localized")

// Must equal the manifest `name` (packages/web/public/manifest.webmanifest) — the string Chrome
// stamps verbatim into the generated bundle's CFBundleName AND the .app filename (verified). Kept
// here (not fetched from the manifest) because this launcher only ever has the origin URL, not the
// manifest body — so KEEP THESE TWO IN LOCKSTEP: renaming the app means editing both, and the
// mismatch drives the stale-shim reinstall that migrates an already-installed bundle to the new name.
const EXPECTED_BUNDLE_NAME = "Frizz"

/**
 * Does this bundle's CFBundleName belong to the CURRENT manifest name?
 *
 * Chrome DISAMBIGUATES a colliding bundle by appending " 1", " 2", … — and collisions are the norm
 * here, not the exception, because `manifestIdFor` is scoped to the ORIGIN and every project gets its
 * own port. So the second project to install a shim becomes "Frizz 1", the third "Frizz 2", and so on.
 *
 * A bare `=== EXPECTED_BUNDLE_NAME` therefore judged every project after the first permanently STALE:
 * each `--app` launch uninstalled and reinstalled the shim, Chrome handed back the next number, and
 * the bundle count grew without the Dock identity ever sticking. Observed on a real machine as
 * Frizz.app / Frizz 1.app / Frizz 2.app / Frizz 3.app — four ports, four bundles, one working shim.
 *
 * Accepting the suffix costs nothing: findAppShim already matched this bundle on the AUTHORITATIVE
 * pair (shortcut URL + user-data-dir), so the name is a rename check, not an identity check. A real
 * manifest rename ("Frizz" → something else) still fails this test and still heals by reinstalling.
