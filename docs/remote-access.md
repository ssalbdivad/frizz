# Remote access

Frizz binds `127.0.0.1` and has no login of its own. To reach a board from a phone or another machine, something in front of it carries the traffic, and Frizz gates the first visit with a single-use sign-in link.

Press **R** in the terminal running Frizz. A walkthrough offers five ways to reach the board, checks what each needs, prints the commands, and remembers your choice — a plain `npx frizz` serves it from then on. **Off** in the same place goes back to loopback only.

```
  Reach this board from anywhere

  ❯ Private name        an unguessable name on frizz.sh — no account, nothing to install
    Custom name         <name>.frizz.sh of your choosing; needs a GitHub account
    Cloudflare Tunnel   a domain you own on Cloudflare; cloudflared on this machine
    Tailscale           your tailnet; tailscale serve does the TLS
    Something else      any proxy or tunnel you run — tell Frizz its address
    Off                 loopback only  (current)
```

Whichever you pick, the board stays bound to loopback. The readout then shows a QR: scanning it trades a single-use code for a session cookie, so the link stops working the moment it is used. Press **L** for a fresh one at any time. A session lasts 30 days, after which the device needs a fresh link.

```sh
npx frizz --link          # a fresh link for a board that is already running — over SSH, for a headless box
npx frizz --sessions      # the devices holding a session
npx frizz --sign-out all  # revoke them
```

A device can sign itself out: **Sign out this device** in Settings ends that browser's session and nothing else. Signing out any other device is still `frizz --sign-out`, which runs only on the host (SSH counts), so a stolen phone cannot sign out the laptop.

## Try it without touching your board

A second Frizz that shares nothing with the one you run: a throwaway home and project, its own port, deleted when you press ctrl-c.

```sh
npx frizz --sandbox
```

Press **R** in it and walk through any setup. Credentials come along (`gh`, cloudflared's certificate and tunnel files, the agent CLIs, and on macOS the login keychain), so every screen sees what the real board sees; the saved setup, the registry and the session key are throwaway copies. One thing is not throwaway: **a custom-name claim is real** — it binds this machine's one name to your GitHub account, and your real board keeps it.

## A private name on frizz.sh

The default, and the shortest path there is: pick it and you are done. Frizz mints an unguessable name — 20 random characters, so nobody can find it by guessing — claims it with this machine's own key, and serves the board at it. No account, no sign-in, no domain, no port forwarding, no extra binary.

```
  Serving https://mk7w2qp9x4n3f6tbz5vh.frizz.sh (frizz.sh).

  Scan to sign in on a phone. Single use, expires in 5 minutes. Press L later for another.
```

The done screen shows that link as a QR code. The name is the address, not the lock: the first visit still needs the single-use sign-in link, so someone who somehow learns the name still meets a closed door.

## A custom name on frizz.sh

The same transport with a name you choose. Pick a word and Frizz claims `<name>.frizz.sh`:

```
  Confirm your GitHub account to claim ada.frizz.sh

  Open      https://github.com/login/device
  Enter     WDJB-MJHT
```

Requires a GitHub account. Chosen names can be squatted, so they cost an identity where random ones do not. Frizz shows a code; enter it at [github.com/login/device](https://github.com/login/device) in any browser, on any device. The sign-in grants Frizz no permissions: the token it yields can read only your public profile. The registrar exchanges it for your account id, discards it, and binds the name to that account. Renewals afterwards need neither, because your machine's key proves ownership, so the name keeps working whether or not GitHub does.

Frizz never reads the GitHub CLI's token. Versions before the device flow sent it with a claim; the registrar now refuses any token that carries a permission, and such a version is told to update.

## How a frizz.sh name behaves

Every launch renews the lease. A name nobody has run for **30 days** is released — a lapsed custom name can be claimed by someone else.

Your board stays on loopback and **dials out** to `frizz.sh`, which is what removes the inbound port, the tunnel binary and the DNS record all at once — a laptop behind any NAT works with no configuration. The connection comes back by itself after a sleep or a network change, so a board is reachable again when the machine is.

### What you are agreeing to

- **One name per machine key, and one custom name per GitHub account.** Accounts less than 30 days old cannot claim a custom name.
- **The name is a lease, not property.** It lapses after 30 days unused, and Frizz can reclaim any name at any time — that is the only enforcement there is, so it has to exist.
- **No warranty.** This is a free convenience on a domain someone else owns. Anything you cannot afford to lose access to belongs on a domain you control; every other section here shows how.
- **Your traffic passes through us.** A name on frizz.sh is served by a relay we run: every request and every keystroke goes through it. Frizz's own access gate still runs on your machine, so a visitor meets it whether or not the relay is honest — but if you would rather no third party carried the bytes, use a domain you control.

## Cloudflare Tunnel

Needs a domain you control on Cloudflare and `cloudflared` on this machine. Create the tunnel and its DNS record once, in another terminal:

```sh
cloudflared tunnel login                                  # pick your zone
cloudflared tunnel create my-board
cloudflared tunnel route dns my-board board.example.com
```

Point the tunnel at the board in `~/.cloudflared/frizz.yml`, which Frizz looks for by name. Keep it out of `config.yml`, whose catch-all shadows other tunnels:

```yaml
tunnel: my-board
credentials-file: /Users/you/.cloudflared/<tunnel-id>.json
ingress:
  - hostname: board.example.com
    service: http://127.0.0.1:9393
  - service: http_status:404
```

Then pick **Cloudflare Tunnel** and name them:

```
  Hostname   board.example.com
  Tunnel     my-board
```

Frizz runs the tunnel beside the board, so the two share a lifetime: a tunnel that outlives its board serves Cloudflare error 1033, and a board that outlives its tunnel is unreachable with nothing to say why.

## Tailscale

Tailscale gives the machine a stable HTTPS name on your tailnet and terminates TLS itself, so only your devices can reach it. Run once, in another terminal:

```sh
tailscale serve --bg 9393     # Frizz's port
```

Then pick **Tailscale**. Frizz reads this machine's MagicDNS name from the daemon and offers it as the origin; enter accepts it.

## Something else

The rule is the same for Caddy, nginx, ngrok or anything else: terminate TLS wherever you like, proxy to `http://127.0.0.1:9393`, and give Frizz the exact origin a browser will show — scheme and host, no path. Frizz answers only to that `Host` and prints its sign-in link for it.

## Headless machines

A machine nobody watches still mints links on demand — sign in over SSH and ask the running board for one:

```sh
ssh you@box npx frizz --link
```

The link prints as a QR and a URL, is single-use, and expires in five minutes. The setup itself is made once from an interactive terminal; the saved choice (`cloud.json`, next to Frizz's registry — `~/Library/Application Support/Frizz` on macOS, `~/.frizz` on an install that already has one) is what a headless launch serves.

## SSH port forwarding

Needs no setup at all. The forwarded port is loopback on both ends, so Frizz treats it as local:

```sh
ssh -L 9393:127.0.0.1:9393 you@your-machine
# then open http://127.0.0.1:9393 on the client
```

Nothing is exposed and no sign-in link is involved. The cost is that the tunnel lives as long as the SSH session, which makes it awkward from a phone.
