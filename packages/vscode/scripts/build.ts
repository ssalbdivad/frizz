// loads `main` with require(). `ws`'s optional native accelerators stay external — it falls back to pure
// JS when they are absent, which in an editor they always are. `vscode` is provided by the host at
// runtime.

//                                 run's editor half (dist/e2e/sidebar-agent.cjs), never packaged
