// A THREAD'S WORKTREE, WORKED IN — the repository the end-to-end runs review (scripts/e2e.ts: the suite in
// FAKE mode builds one inside the workspace; STACK mode seeds one in the tenant project and a transcript
// whose agent edited it). Real git, every kind of change a review must show and everything it must not:
//
//   committed on the branch   src/loop.ts modified, src/feature.ts added, docs/old.md deleted,
//                             src/rename-me.ts renamed to src/renamed.ts
//   uncommitted               src/feature.ts edited again, src/fresh.ts never added
//   never shown               node_modules/ (ignored), logo.png (binary), main-only.md (landed on main
//                             AFTER the fork: a base at main's tip would show the branch deleting it)
//
// Pure node, no `vscode`: the suite runs it inside the editor's extension host, the harness outside it.
