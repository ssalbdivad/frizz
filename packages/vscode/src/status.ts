// THE STATUS BAR ITEM, as data: what it says, what hovering it says, and what clicking it does.
//
// Connected, it is "Frizz", with this workspace's Queue count beside it when anything is waiting on the
// human — the one number worth a glance from the editor, and the one the sidebar's badge shows. A click
// shows the Frizz sidebar, where those threads are. "Queued" and "running" are the page's own words
// for the queue and for what is spinning (its bands, Queue and Running, since 2026-10-06; Ready and
// Working before). A project the server has not opened yet has no counts (the
// `projects` push omits them), and says nothing rather than claiming zero.
//
// Offline, it stays short — a window with no Frizz running should not shout about it in every status
// bar — and the tooltip says what is true and that a click tries again.
