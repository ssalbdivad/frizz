// FRIZZ'S RPC SURFACE, from the extension host — the same procedures the page calls, over plain fetch.
//
// The wire is packages/rpc/src/server.ts: a query is `GET <prefix>/<proc>?input=<url-encoded JSON>`, a
// mutation is `POST` with a JSON body, and the answer is `{ result }` or `{ error, retryable? }`.
// `retryable: true` means the server refused at a contention gate before anything took effect, so the
// identical request may be sent again; any other failure is ambiguous and must not be.
//
// Always PROJECT-ID-addressed: `/_frizz/<projectId>/rpc/<proc>`. An unprefixed path is whichever project
// launched the server, and a slug can be renamed out from under a long-lived client.
//
// The origin gate (server app.ts) admits a request with no Origin only when it carries
// `sec-fetch-site: same-origin`, which a browser never lets a cross-site page send — exactly what the
// worker MCP shim sends (cc-worker/bin/frizz-mcp.mjs), and what this sends.
