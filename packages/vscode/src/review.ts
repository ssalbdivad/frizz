// A THREAD'S CHANGES, AS GIT TELLS THEM — what "Review changes" opens as VS Code's multi-file diff, the
// pure half (no `vscode`; review-view.ts is the glue and the content provider). Frizz names WHICH
// checkouts the thread changed (server review-target.ts, `EditorReviewCheckout`); this asks git, in each,
// what to compare against and which files differ. Design: plans/vscode-extension.md § Reviewing a
// thread's changes.
//
// THE BASE. Frizz records nothing about where a thread started, so it is read off git:
//
//   "files" — the project folder, which several agents and the human share. Its review is the thread's
//     own files against HEAD: their uncommitted changes. Nothing else changed in that tree is the
//     thread's to show, and a commit there carries other people's work as readily as this thread's.
//   "branch" — a worktree, the thread's own. Its review is everything since its branch LEFT the branch it
//     came from, committed or not. Candidates, each turned into a merge-base with HEAD:
//       · where the branch was created — the oldest entry of its reflog, "branch: Created from X", which
//         `git worktree add -b <slug> <path> [start]` writes. It survives the branch being merged back,
//         after which every tip below already holds HEAD and can say nothing;
//       · X itself when X names a branch (`… main`), at its CURRENT tip: a thread that merged X in since
//         has a newer merge-base with it, and the files X brought are not the thread's;
//       · the branch the project folder (the main worktree) is on, for a branch made from a bare commit
//         or one whose reflog is gone.
//     A tip that already contains HEAD (the thread's branch merged into it) is skipped, and of the rest
//     the base with the FEWEST commits to HEAD wins: the nearest point the thread's own work starts from.
//     None at all (a detached worktree made from a commit, no main branch): HEAD, its uncommitted changes.
//
// THE FILES. `git diff <base>` compares the base with the WORKING TREE, so committed, staged and unsaved-
// to-git edits all show, with renames paired (branch scope); untracked files the checkout does not ignore
// join them as added. Binary files are listed apart: the diff editor shows text, and a PNG as text is
// noise. Every git call is read-only and takes no optional lock (GIT_OPTIONAL_LOCKS=0), since the tree it
// reads is often one other agents are writing in.
