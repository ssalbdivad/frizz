// WHAT A FRAMED FRIZZ PAGE MAY ASK OF THE EDITOR — answered the same wherever the page is framed: the
// sidebar (sidebar.ts) or a thread in an editor tab (thread-panel.ts). Each frame keeps what is its own —
// when its page is ready, the composes it waits on, what its route means to the frame around it (the
// sidebar's title row, a tab's title) — and hands every other page message here: a file or a web link to
// open, a forwarded key chord, the editor's context into a composer, the eye, a review, files for `@`.
//
// Only `import type` from vscode, like app.ts.
