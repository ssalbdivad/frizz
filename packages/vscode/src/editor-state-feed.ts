// THE EDITOR, REPORTED TO FRIZZ FOR ITS AGENTS — reads what this window shows (the file in front, its
// selection and text, the tabs, the errors and warnings) and has the connection send it as the `editor`
// frame whenever it changes, so a worker's `mcp__frizz__editor` always reads the current picture. The
// rules — what is carried, the caps, the order, the fitting — are pure, in editor-state.ts; this is the
// glue. Only `import type` from vscode, like app.ts.
//
// WHAT is in front, and whether its text may go, is editor-watcher.ts's (one rule, editor-front.ts), the
// same answer the sidebar's page feed gets — so the agent's tool, the context bar and the block a send
// carries cannot disagree. What stays here is the tool's own:
//   - THE CEILING, 32 Ki characters (EDITOR_STATE_MAX_SELECTION_TEXT), twice the page feed's: read once,
//     when an agent asks, rather than riding every message. A longer selection carries its start, flagged.
//   - THE CADENCE, 250ms of quiet: the frame also carries the diagnostics, which a language server
//     re-publishes on every keystroke, and what is on screen, which moves with every scroll; nobody watches
//     it change, so a drag or a burst of typing is one frame, not forty.
//
// When it sends: after DEBOUNCE_MS of quiet following any change of the editor in front, its selection,
// what is on screen, the tabs, a document's text or dirty state, or the diagnostics — and at once on a
// change of `frizz.shareEditorState`. The connection sends it once more on every connect and drops a frame
// identical to the last it sent (connection.ts sendEditor).
