// THE EDITOR, AS THE SIDEBAR SEES IT — the pure half of what the extension tells the Frizz sidebar about
// the editor around it (`frizz:editor-context`: the file in front, its selection with the selection's text
// or else the caret's line, the other open files) and of the ways a piece of the editor gets into the
// sidebar's prompt (a problem's quick fix, a terminal selection). No `vscode` here, so every rule is a
// unit test under plain node (editor-context.test.ts); context-feed.ts and app.ts are the glue. Design:
// plans/vscode-extension.md § The editor in the sidebar; the wire: packages/shared/src/embed-protocol.ts.
