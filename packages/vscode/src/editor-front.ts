// THE EDITOR IN FRONT — the one reading of "what the human has in front of them" that BOTH of the
// extension's editor feeds derive from: the sidebar's page feed (context-feed.ts → the context bar, and the
// block a sidebar send carries on its own) and the agents' feed (editor-state-feed.ts → the `editor` frame
// → `mcp__frizz__editor`). Pure: no `vscode` here, so every rule is a unit test under plain node
// (editor-front.test.ts); editor-watcher.ts is the glue that holds the window's editors to these rules.
//
// WHY ONE. Until 2026-10-02 the two feeds were two observers written by two builders, and they disagreed
// about the same moment: the page's read `file:` documents only, went blank when an output pane or the
// debug console took focus, and carried no dirty flag, while the agents' read untitled buffers too, kept
// the last file editor on screen when an output pane had focus, and knew about unsaved changes. So with
// the Output panel focused the bar said nothing was in front, the send carried nothing, and the agent's
// tool read the file the human had been pointing at — three surfaces, two answers. Now there is one front
// rule (`pickFront`), one way to read it (`editorFront`), and one privacy rule (`secretFile`); each feed
// keeps only what is genuinely its own — its text ceiling and its cadence (see the two feeds' headers).
//
// What counts as "in front":
//   - a text editor on a file on disk or an untitled buffer — never an output pane, a git revision (a
//     diff's left side), a settings UI or a webview. The modified side of a working-tree diff IS a file on
//     disk, and a selection there is code the human is pointing at (an agent's change under review), so it
//     counts, as it does for Claude Code's own getCurrentSelection.
//   - the ACTIVE text editor when it is one of those; else the last one that was, while it is still on
//     screen. Focus in an output pane or the debug console makes THAT the active text editor in VS Code;
//     without the fallback the selection the human was pointing at a moment ago would blank.

// A selection's TEXT goes to Frizz without the human asking in two ways: the block on every sidebar send,
// and the agents' tool. Neither should carry the contents of a file that obviously holds credentials — a
// selection left standing in `.env` while the human asks an unrelated question would put the keys into a
// transcript, and from there into a provider's logs. The path is still named (the agent may need to know
// the human is looking at their config) and the human can still add the text on purpose, as a chip (Ctrl+L
// and the bar's click are explicit, and stay so). Claude Code withholds the same way; its list is longer
// (gitignored files), but a gitignored build output is not a secret, and an agent told "not quoted" for
// every file under dist/ would be told it for nothing.
//
// By NAME, deliberately loose on the safe side: a false positive costs an agent one file read, a false
// negative costs a key. Plus whatever the human hides from VS Code itself (`files.exclude`), which the
// glue matches with VS Code's own glob engine (editor-watcher.ts), since a pattern there is the human
// saying "not this".
