// THE SELECTION HINT — Cursor's quiet "⌘L to chat" beside a fresh selection, for Frizz: a line of faded
// text after the selection, `Ctrl+L to add to Frizz` (`⌘L` on a Mac), so the chord is discoverable where the
// human is already looking instead of only in a README and the `?` sheet. It is a text-editor decoration
// (`after.contentText`), not a widget: nothing to click, nothing that takes focus, nothing a screen reader
// announces on every selection, and it cannot cover code — it sits past the end of a line.
//
// WHEN it shows — every rule is a reason a hint there would lie, nag or flicker:
//   - a NON-EMPTY primary selection, in the ACTIVE text editor, on a file on disk, in a plain text tab:
//     `Ctrl+L` adds the primary selection of a file editor (app.ts addToPrompt) and refuses anything else
//     (an untitled buffer, a git revision), so the hint is only where the chord works.
//   - NOT in a diff (side-by-side, inline or the multi-file "Changes" view) — the tab in the editor's group
//     must be a plain `TabInputText` of that very file. A diff is where the human reviews, often an agent's
//     change Frizz itself opened; a line of ghost text after every selection there competes with the diff's
//     own inline decorations and reads as part of the change. The chord still works in a diff; it is only
//     not advertised there. Output panes, the debug console, settings JSON and notebooks fall out of the
//     file-on-disk rule already.
//   - NOT a select-all (the selection spans the whole document): Ctrl+A is a step toward copy, cut, format
//     or replace far more often than toward a question, the caret then sits on the file's last line where
//     the hint would land off screen anyway, and the human who means the whole file has Alt+K and Add file
//     to Frizz prompt.
//   - NOT a selection an extension set, or a jump made: VS Code reports both as `kind` Command (its
//     extension host maps the sources "api", "code.jump" and "code.navigation" to it, and nothing else).
//     Frizz's own file links select the lines they name (app.ts openFromFrizz), and a hint on a selection
//     the human did not make is noise. Keyboard, mouse, and the editor's own commands — expand selection,
//     Ctrl+D, a find match, which VS Code reports with no kind at all — all count.
//   - NOT a selection already added: after Ctrl+L (or any add of that selection) the hint has done its job,
//     until the selection changes.
//   - SETTLED: 250ms after the last change, cleared AT ONCE on any change, so a drag or a held Shift+Arrow
//     shows nothing until the hand stops, and nothing lags behind the caret.
//   - only while this window is CONNECTED to Frizz (the chord says "Frizz isn't running" otherwise), and
//     while `frizz.selectionHint` is on. The window losing focus clears it; the next selection brings it.
//   - NOT in Cursor or Windsurf: each draws its own selection hint naming its own chat's chord, and in
//     Cursor that chord is the same Ctrl+L / ⌘L — two hints for one chord would leave the human guessing
//     which answers (README § Where the sidebar differs).
//
// WHERE: past the end of the selection's line nearest the caret — its last line when it was made
// downward, its first when made upward — where the eye already is. "Last line" follows the chip's own
// count (editor-context.ts lineSpan): a whole-line drag that ends at column 1 of the next line ends on the
// line BEFORE it, as the chip reads, so the hint never sits on a line that is not part of what it adds.
//
// WHICH chord: the one bound by default, Ctrl+L, or ⌘L where the window's UI runs on a Mac — which under a
// remote window is not the extension host's platform, so the sidebar's relay (which runs in the UI) says
// it when it can, and the extension host's own platform stands in until then.
//
// Pure rules first (selection-hint.test.ts runs them under plain node); the VS Code glue after, with only
// `import type` from vscode, like app.ts.
