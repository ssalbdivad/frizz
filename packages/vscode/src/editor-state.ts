// THE EDITOR, AS AN AGENT READS IT — the pure half of the `editor` frame (packages/shared/src/
// editor-protocol.ts EditorSnapshot): the file in front with its selection and the selected text, the
// other open tabs, and the editor's errors and warnings, built from plain inputs and FITTED to what Frizz
// takes. A worker reads it through `mcp__frizz__editor`, the way Claude Code's own agent reads its IDE
// (getCurrentSelection, getOpenEditors, getDiagnostics). editor-state-feed.ts reads the inputs out of
// VS Code; connection.ts sends the result. No `vscode` here, so every rule is a unit test under plain
// node (editor-state.test.ts).
//
// Two rules carry the weight:
//   - NOTHING GOES OUT THAT FRIZZ WILL REFUSE. A refused frame closes the socket 4401, and the same frame
//     is refused again on every redial — forever, for as long as the human keeps that selection. So every
//     count and length is capped here to the server's schema, and the whole frame is fitted into
//     EDITOR_STATE_MAX_BYTES encoded, trimming in the order that loses the least: the diagnostics from the
//     end (the other files' warnings go first), then the open tabs from the end (the least recent), and only
//     then the selected text, from its end, flagged `truncated`.
//   - THE ORDER IS THE PRIORITY. The diagnostics are every error before any warning, and within each the
//     file in front first — so a file with two hundred lint warnings cannot push an error elsewhere out of
//     the hundred that fit.
