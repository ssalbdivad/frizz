// WHICH BUILD THIS IS — the identity scripts/build.ts stamps into the bundle and beside it.
//
// Every build said `0.1.0`, and the server dropped the hello's version on the floor, so when the
// maintainer asked "is this window running the fix?" nobody could say: not the output channel, not the
// status bar, not Frizz (review-final.md item 7). Now each build carries its version, the commit it was
// built from (and whether the tree had uncommitted changes in what the bundle is made of), when it was
// built, and a random id. The label — `0.1.0+1a2b3c4d`, `0.1.0+1a2b3c4d-dirty` — is what the hello, the
// log and the status bar's tooltip say; the id is what tells two builds apart, since two builds of one
// dirty tree share a label.
//
// The same record is written to `dist/build.json`, which ships in the .vsix. A window keeps running the
// code it loaded, so when `nub run vscode:install` puts a new build on disk the window offers to reload
// (`installedBuild`): it compares the id on disk with its own.
//
// Pure node, no `vscode`: build-info.test.ts runs it over folders laid out the way VS Code lays out an
// extensions directory.
