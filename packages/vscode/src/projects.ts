// WHICH FRIZZ PROJECT A FILE BELONGS TO. The server pushes every registered project with the folder its
// agents run in (`dir`); a file belongs to the project whose folder holds it — the LONGEST such folder,
// since projects nest (a repo checked out inside another's tree) — and to Home only when no registered
// project holds it, because Home's folder is the home directory and holds nearly everything. This is the
// server's own rule (router.ts `enclosingProject`).
//
// The file is compared by its REAL path as well as by the spelling the editor gave: a workspace opened
// through a symlink names files the server knows only by their canonical path. Both spellings are tried
// against both spellings of each project folder, and the spelling that matched is the one returned, so
// the relative path shown to the agent is the project-relative one.
//
// Windows compares without case and with either separator, as Windows itself does.
