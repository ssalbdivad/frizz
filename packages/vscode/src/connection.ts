// THE EDITOR SOCKET — this window's one live line to Frizz (`/_frizz/editor`, packages/shared
// editor-protocol.ts; design in plans/vscode-extension.md).
//
// The extension dials out: Frizz is a singleton with a known way to find it, every editor window is a
// client of it. Over the socket this window says which folders it has open and whether it has focus,
// and Frizz sends it files to open, folders to raise and the projects its folders belong to.
//
// What keeps it honest:
//   - Discovery runs again before EVERY attempt. The private port behind the restart supervisor moves on
//     each restart, and a Frizz started after this window opened has to be found, not remembered.
//   - The upgrade carries `Origin: http://127.0.0.1:<port>` — the server refuses a socket without one,
//     and the restart supervisor destroys it without even a status line. That is why this uses the `ws`
//     package: the WHATWG WebSocket cannot set Origin.
//   - Backoff from 1s to 30s, jittered so N windows a restart dropped do not stampede it together, and
//     reset by a `welcome` — not by a bare TCP connect, which a broken server also accepts.
//   - Silence is a dead link. Frizz sends `hb` every 15s; 45s without any frame and the socket is torn
//     down and dialled again (a sleeping laptop's socket can stay "open" for minutes after the far end
//     is gone).
//   - One log line per change of state, not per retry: a window left open on a stopped Frizz would
//     otherwise write a line every 30s for days.
//   - Nothing goes out that Frizz will refuse. A refused hello (4401) is refused again on every redial,
//     forever, so the folders a window reports are fitted to Frizz's limits (`fitFolders`) rather than
//     sent whole, and the editor's picture is fitted to its byte ceiling (editor-state.ts).
//   - Nothing goes out that Frizz does not know. The server closes the socket on a frame it has never
//     heard of, so the `editor` frame — newer than v1 — goes only to a Frizz whose welcome names it
//     (`features`). An older Frizz simply never hears it, and its agents cannot read the editor. A field
//     newer than the frame (a selection's `withheld`) is spelled the way that Frizz's schema takes
//     (`forServer`): its schema is strict, so an unknown key would be refused like an unknown frame. The
//     same for this window's own `features` frame (it can show a thread's changes), sent only to a Frizz
//     whose welcome names `review`: the one way Frizz learns a window can, since the hello reaches every Frizz.
//
// Pure node (no `vscode` import): the host interface is how the window is reached, and the tests drive
// this against a real `ws` server in-process.
