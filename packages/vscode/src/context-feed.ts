// THE EDITOR'S LIVE CONTEXT, FED TO THE SIDEBAR — `frizz:editor-context` (packages/shared/src/
// embed-protocol.ts): the text editor in front, its selection with the primary selection's text (or the
// caret's line, with nothing selected), whether it is unsaved or untitled, and the other files open in
// tabs, posted to the sidebar's page whenever it is ready and they change. The page's context bar shows
// it, and a message sent from the sidebar carries the selection, or the file and line, while the human
// shares the editor (frizz.shareEditorState, the bar's eye; packages/web/src/lib/editorContext.ts
// outgoingMessage). The text is in the feed rather than fetched at send so Enter sends at once.
//
// WHAT is in front is not this file's to decide: editor-watcher.ts holds the one rule (editor-front.ts),
// which the agents' feed (editor-state-feed.ts) reads too, so the bar, the block and the tool agree. What
// stays here is the page's own shape (labels, projects, the caps in editor-context.ts) and two things that
// are genuinely the page's:
//   - THE CEILING, 16 Ki characters of text (EMBED_MAX_SELECTION_TEXT), half the tool's 32 Ki: this text
//     rides EVERY send from the sidebar and is re-posted on every settled selection change whether or not
//     the human sends anything, while the tool's is read once, when an agent asks. embed-protocol.ts has
//     the full reasoning.
//   - THE CADENCE, 100ms of quiet, against the tool's 250ms: this feed drives a bar the human is watching
//     as they select, which must keep up with the hand; the tool's frame also carries the diagnostics a
//     language server re-publishes on every keystroke, and nobody watches it.
//
// When it sends: once the moment the page says it is ready (a reloaded page knows nothing), and again on
// a change of the editor in front, its selection or caret line, the selected text itself (an edit under a
// held selection: the agent working on that file), its dirty flag (the first keystroke, a save), the tab
// set, or the sharing setting. A payload identical to the last one sent is not sent again — typing on one
// line changes nothing the feed says — and nothing is sent while no page is ready.
//
// Sharing off, the selection's TEXT stays home (the lines are still named, so the bar can show them and a
// click can still add them on purpose); a withheld file's text never leaves (editor-front.ts secretFile).
//
// Only `import type` from vscode, like app.ts.
