// What a worker can actually GET AT. A format qualifies two ways: an agent's Read/file tool consumes
// it with no conversion step (images, PDF, text, code), or its bytes are a documented container the
// agent cracks with a tool it installs in one command — openpyxl/pandas for a spreadsheet, python-docx
// and python-pptx for a document, duckdb/pyarrow for a columnar dump, the sqlite3 CLI for a database,
// unzip/tar for an archive, and pandoc or LibreOffice (often already on the machine) for most of the
// rest. Office, columnar and archive formats were REFUSED until 2026-08-27 on the theory that they'd
// reach the agent as opaque zip/XML garbage; that underrates the agent, and the cost of the refusal
// landed on the person, who had to convert the file by hand before Frizz would take it. A dropped file
// lands on disk and its absolute path — inserted as plain text into the message — is what the worker
// opens; nothing here is parsed, rendered or extracted by Frizz itself.
//
// Widening this list widens NOTHING else. /local-image serves only its own content-type map (which
// mirrors ATTACHMENT_IMAGE_EXTENSIONS), and the desktop-open action gates on trusted ROOTS rather than
// on extension (local-file.ts). What the list decides is exactly: what /attach writes to disk, what the
// file picker offers, and which standalone path lines become openable chips (web lib/imagePaths.ts).

// Inline-renderable raster images: served back to the chat via the gated /local-image proxy and seen
// visually by the agent. SVG is DELIBERATELY not here — it is an XSS vector when served as an image

// ---- THE AWAITING FENCE ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// A worker ends every turn in ONE terminal state: it needs the human, it is waiting on work that is
// actually running, or it is finished. Each is now said EITHER by a fence or by a registration — a
// `thread_question` row asked at THIS rest is a standing sign-off on its own, and so is an armed watch or
// a recorded done, which is why a worker that has just asked rests normally and writes no fence at all.
// A question still open from an EARLIER rest is not: the worker names it under `questions:` or withdraws
// it (2026-10-05). This is the FENCE form of the middle one, and it is PURE STRUCTURE — a list of things
// frizz can look up, a duration, and one line of prose.
//
//   shells: [<runtime task id>, …]   background shells it launched   → checked against live telemetry
//   agents: [<runtime agent id>, …]  sub-agents it dispatched        → checked against live telemetry
//   timers: [tmr_…, …]               timers it set                   → checked against thread_timer
//   prs:    [owner/repo#123, …]      PR watchers it registered       → checked against its PR registry
//   for:    2h                       REQUIRED. How long the park may stand (parseAwaitingDurationRaw).
//                                    Capped at a day — or at PR_WATCH_FOR_MAX_MS when every item is a
//                                    `prs:` entry, because an external PR does not move on a day's clock.
//                                    An `agents:` entry caps it at 30m instead: AGENT_PARK_FOR_MAX_MS.
//   title:  Waiting on the CI run    OPTIONAL. The resting card's heading, in the worker's own words.
//   status: watching                 REQUIRED for a thread dispatched at or after NEEDS_INPUT_REQUIRED_AT.
//                                    Where the thread sits while it waits, in the worker's own word:
//                                    `needs_input` (the human should look now — the queue), `working`
//                                    (its own work finishes by itself — Running) or `watching` (something
//                                    must happen outside the thread — Snoozed). See awaitingStatus.
//   needs_input: false               The 2026-10-01 spelling of the same answer, read as an alias:
//                                    `true` is `status: needs_input`; `false` leaves the band to the
//                                    board's default (see awaitingNeedsInput, board.deriveWaitStatus).
//   steps:                           OPTIONAL. Steps only the HUMAN can perform — a sign-in, an
//     - Run `npm login`              approval, a merge the worker may not make — one `- ` item per
//     - Approve the browser prompt   line, read VERBATIM (see awaitingSteps). A fence carrying them
//                                    waits on the human: it needs no other name and no `for:`, and it
//                                    always queues (awaitingNeedsInput reads it as `true`).
//   questions: [qst_…, …]            The worker's registered questions it is STILL waiting on. A fence
//                                    beside open questions must name every one of them (anything else
//                                    is withdrawn with `unask`), and a card it names is drawn at THIS
//                                    rest (see awaitingQuestions). Like `steps:` it names the human as
//                                    the wait: no other name and no `for:` needed, and it always queues.
//
// THE FRONTMATTER IS REAL YAML (2026-08-24), parsed by the `yaml` package — the keys are PLURAL and take
// SEQUENCES, block or flow. A bare scalar where a sequence is expected is accepted and normalised to a
// one-element list, because that is the shape a worker most often reaches for and refusing it buys
// nothing. Everything the human reads is prose below the `---`.
//
// …then, after a `---` line, as much arbitrary Markdown as the worker wants (2026-08-17). The structural
// lines are FRONTMATTER; the delimiter is what makes "is this line structural?" answerable, which is what
// lets a retired or unknown kind be refused by name instead of silently swallowed as prose.
//
// IT IS YAML SINCE 2026-08-24, AND THE ONE THING THAT MADE IT IMPOSSIBLE BEFORE WAS `reason:`. This block
// used to read "IT IS NOT YAML, AND MUST NOT BECOME YAML", on three measurements taken 2026-08-17 against
// the real `yaml` package. All three still reproduce — and two of them are about PROSE, not structure:
//
//   `reason: waiting on your merge: the propKeys revert`  → parse error (nested mappings)
//   `reason: see #6422`                                   → silently {"reason":"see"} (` #` opens a comment)
//   two `shell:` lines                                    → parse error (map keys must be unique)
//
// A worker's prose carries colons and `#`-refs constantly, and no YAML parser will take the rest of a
// line verbatim. So `reason:` is RETIRED (below) — the `---` body had already superseded it — and with it
// gone the frontmatter is pure data. The duplicate-key objection is what the plural keys answer; the old
// note conceded arrays would fix it and judged them not worth it, which was right while `reason:` was
// still in the frontmatter and wrong once it left. Re-measured 2026-08-24: `prs: [owner/repo#123]` parses
// correctly (no space before the `#`, so it is not a comment), as do block sequences and mixed kinds.
//
// TWO NEW FAILURE MODES COME WITH IT, and both are handled rather than hoped away: a TAB indent is a hard
// parse error (so a parse failure must BUMP the worker with the error, never park it), and a key with
// nothing under it yields `null` silently (so an empty sequence is refused, not read as a park).
//
// REGISTRATION IS ORTHOGONAL TO THIS FENCE (maintainer 2026-08-15). Dispatching a shell or a sub-agent,
// setting a timer, registering a PR watcher — none of that is a fence, and none of it parks anything.
// Those things simply exist and frizz watches them. The fence is only how a worker declares that it has
// STOPPED, and names which of them it stopped for.
//
// EVERY NAME IS CHECKED, THE MOMENT THE FENCE LANDS. All valid ⇒ the thread goes to Held. Any name that
// is dead, unknown, or another thread’s ⇒ the worker is BUMPED immediately. It does not fail open and it
// does not park: a wait that cannot resolve must never be able to look like one that can.
//
// WHAT WAS DELETED, AND WHY, BECAUSE EACH ONE WAS A WAY TO STALL SILENTLY:
//   `human: <person>`  parked a thread in Held and NOTHING EVER FIRED IT. Waiting on a person to DECIDE
//                      is a registered question; waiting on one to ACT is `steps:` (2026-10-03), which
//                      keeps the thread IN the queue — and the human's reply is the wake.
//   `timer: <instant>` an absolute instant the worker computed. One was written 5h55m in the past; it
//                      parsed, armed nothing, and stalled its thread for 5.5 hours. `for:` is a duration
//                      precisely so this cannot be expressed (see parseAwaitingDurationRaw).
//   `pr-watch: ref`    free text the poller armed from. A PR is now a registered watcher with an id.
//   `watch: id`        superseded: a shell is named directly by its runtime handle.
//   `ci:`/`session:`   legacy conditions nothing has fired for a long time.
//   the SINGULAR keys  `shell:`/`agent:`/`timer:`/`pr:` — one line per item, repeated. YAML cannot express
//                      a repeated key, so they became the plural sequence keys above (2026-08-24).
//   `reason:`          the last prose in the frontmatter, and the reason it could not be YAML. It moves
//                      below the `---`, where it always belonged and where it has no length limit.
//   prose bodies       narrowed to `reason:` so the fence is machine-checkable — then given back in full
//                      below the `---` delimiter, where prose cannot be mistaken for structure.

 *  before 2026-08-17 parses.
 *
 *  A RETIRED or UNKNOWN key never reaches the YAML parser, and that is not an optimisation. A retired key
 *  would otherwise surface as an opaque "map keys must be unique" or a nested-mapping error, when the
 *  worker needs to be told BY NAME what replaced it — the scheduler reads those lines back out of the

 *
 *  THE TITLE NEVER REACHES THE YAML PARSER EITHER. It is the one line of PROSE the frontmatter still
 *  carries — a heading in the worker's own words — and prose is exactly what YAML cannot hold: a ` #`
 *  starts a comment, a `: ` starts a nested mapping, a leading quote must close. On 2026-09-10 a worker
 *  wrote `title: De-slop rewrite of the #64172 comment` — naming the PR, as the contract tells it to in
 *  every resting message — and the card drew "De-slop rewrite of the" with no ellipsis and no error,
 *  because YAML had read the PR number as a comment. A colon would have been worse: the whole
 *  frontmatter fails to parse, and a fence that named a live sub-agent and a PR parks NOTHING. So the
 *  title is read verbatim off its line (plus any indented continuation), and only the lookups stay YAML.
 *
 *  `steps:` IS READ VERBATIM FOR THE SAME REASON, and more urgently: a step is an instruction, and an
 *  instruction is the prose most likely to carry what YAML cannot hold. `- Run \`npm login\`` is a parse
 *  error outright (a backtick may not open a plain scalar), `- Approve it: use the org account` silently
 *  becomes a one-key mapping, and either failure would cost the fence every lookup beside it. So each
 *  `- ` item under the key is taken as written, an indented line continues the item above it, and a

// achieve that by just disabling both of the other two toggles").

// the argument for keeping them apart rested on something that is no longer true. While a beat was held
// until the thread rested, a schedule could only ever deliver AT a rest — and the rest trigger fires at
// every rest — so with one shared text the schedule's deliveries were a strict subset of the rest
// trigger's: same words, same instants, nothing added. Mid-turn delivery is what pulled the two apart,

// even if it doesn't" is ONE intent that used to cost two prompts and two toggles to express.

//
// IT USED TO BE A SENTINEL WORD, `ALLDONE`, and collapsing the two is the change. One vocabulary beats
// two: the worker already has to end its turn with a fence, and a second magic token that ALSO means
// "stop" was a rule to remember on top of a rule to remember. Maintainer 2026-08-11: "we should drop
// ALLDONE in favor of simply ```done".
//
// It is not a "skip this one" — it is the end of the arrangement, and nothing but new activity on the
// thread reopens it. Every delivered message therefore names it in one de-emphasized line and warns

// silently parks an effort nobody is watching.
//
// Mechanically it needs no stored state at all, which is what makes it honest: both the fence and the
// legacy sentinel are folded off the FINAL assistant message, so either holds for exactly as long as
// that message is the thread's last word. Anything the thread says or receives afterwards reopens the
// loop by itself.

// Claude Code narrates its OWN control action into the transcript: every turn cut short leaves a bare

// so the marker landed as a human bubble directly above the very message that caused it, saying nothing
// the reader did not just do (maintainer 2026-08-14). The broker's own shutdown writes the same record,
// which is worse: nobody typed anything at all.
//
// EXACT match on the trimmed text, deliberately not a prefix: all 306 of these records across the 3933
// transcripts on this machine are one of these two strings ALONE in a single text block, so a human
// message that opens by quoting the marker keeps its bubble.
//
// Lives HERE rather than in transcript.ts (its first caller) because the tailer needs it too — an

//
// IT REACHES EVERY THREAD, including one driving itself on an armed Goal. That case was carved out for a
// day (2026-08-13 → 2026-08-14, when the Goal still carried a question-hold switch) on the reading that
// the invariant is about a queue a HUMAN triages, so a thread nobody is waiting on does not need it. Two
// things sank that: this text now opens by sending a half-finished thread back to the WORK rather than
// offering a menu of ways to stop, so it no longer pulls against the Goal arriving beside it; and it is
// the only delivery that names the ```awaiting park at all (the Goal's own trailer deliberately does not
// — see restPromptMessage), so silencing it left the longest-running threads — the self-driving ones, the
// ones most likely to hold background work — with no way to learn how to park on it.
//
// SHORT, because it competes with the agent's own conclusion for attention, and because a long one
// invites the agent to treat "how do I sign off?" as the task. Three facts and a shape.
//

// `DEFAULT_RECURRING_PROMPT` lopsided — see the comment there). The two deliveries land on the SAME rest
// and must not pull against each other: a nudge whose first instruction is "pick one of these three ways
// to stop" hands a half-finished thread a menu with no correct entry on it, and the agent picks the
// closest — usually `done`, which is a dismissal. So the fence menu is now the OTHERWISE branch, and the

// invariant: a thread that goes back to work leaves the queue by SPINNING, which is the outcome the

// left, go back to the work" and spends sixty lines on ceilings, documents and questions. Read at a worker
// that is legitimately waiting on a build it just launched, every line of that is the wrong framing.
// Measured 2026-09-29 → 10-01: 46 nudges, ~20 of them to a worker resting behind a live shell, sub-agent
// or Workflow, and every one of those answered with a correct ```awaiting fence 2–3s later — a turn and
// a wall of "unfinished work" prose spent to produce one fence the worker already meant to write.
//
// So a bare rest with a running shell gets THIS: the shells by the id the runtime gave the worker, the
// fence already written for them, and one line for the case where the work is in fact finished. The
// worker deletes what it is not waiting on and sets `for:`; nothing else is left to compose, so nothing
// else can be got wrong.
//
// IT IS STILL A NUDGE, NOT A PARK. Treating a live shell as an implicit park was the alternative and it
// was turned down: 26% of real background launches are servers that never exit (see board.ts on the
// shell excusal that was tried and reverted on 2026-08-04), so a forgotten dev server would hold its
// thread out of the queue forever, silently. Asking costs one short turn; inferring costs a lost thread.
//
// SHELLS, because they are the one live thing that does NOT already park. A running direct sub-agent
// — a `Workflow` run is one too — excuses its parent from the queue on its own, so the nudge does not
// fire behind one at all (board.signoffNudgeVerdict) — EXCEPT on a thread with a Goal armed at rest,
// which a child does not hold: there the children are listed here too, with an `agents:` line, because
// that fence is the one thing that quiets the Goal until they return. Timers, PRs and issues are
// registrations, not running work; they ride along as lines to add, never pre-filled, because a shell
// wait and a PR wait are different waits and the fence must name only what this rest is for.

// THEY ARE INVISIBLE IN THE CHAT, and that is the whole reason these two strings live here. A
// correction is frizz talking to the AGENT about its own grammar — there is no news in it and nothing
// for the human to do — and left as a first-party card it dominated the very handoff it was complaining
// about, then sat above the worker's re-fence as a second, louder copy of a conversation the human was
// never part of (maintainer 2026-08-19, with a screenshot of exactly that). It is the same verdict the
// sign-off nudge got on 2026-08-12, one step further: that one collapses to a hairline, this one is
// dropped from the transcript entirely.
//

// open thread on disk disappear too — a marker would only ever reach the ones written after it shipped.

// and the clock ran out — it is the wake that ENDED the park, and the reason the thread is moving again.

// is bytes in a message; the row is the only lifecycle). PR #33 proposed settling fences by matching
// the human's later Answers: turns against them, and the maintainer declined it for what it is: guessing
// which historical fences are done (2026-09-11: "I don't like the idea of guessing at which question

// THE WORKER DECIDES WHETHER A REST NEEDS THE HUMAN (maintainer 2026-10-01). Until this cut, whether a
// thread resting on running work sat in the queue or in the Active band was frizz's GUESS, one rule per
// kind of wait: a live sub-agent kept it out, a shell did not, a declared shell did, a watched PR did
// only while its CI ran. Each rule was a guess about what the worker wanted, and the worker knows — a
// worker with a sub-agent out and half a report the human could already act on had no way to say so
// short of asking a question or claiming `done` (maintainer: "the agent should have the ability to
// specifically signal whether or not the user is needed or not").
//
// So a worker that rests on running work now SAYS it, in the ```awaiting fence: `needs_input: true` puts
// the thread in the queue while the work runs, `needs_input: false` keeps it out. The answer is REQUIRED
// on every such rest ("we should make it required so the agent always needs to provide an answer here"),
// and only on such rests — `done` and a registered question already are the answer "yes". A rest on
// running work with no fence is a bare rest: queued, and the sign-off nudge teaches the fence.
//
// The safety rules are the fence's own and nothing new: a `false` parks only while every item it names
// is live and its `for:` has not run out (awaiting.parkIsHonoured), so a wrong `false` cannot hide a
// thread that nothing will ever wake.
//
// BY DISPATCH INSTANT, for the reason QUESTION_FENCE_RETIRED_AT gives: a running thread keeps the
// contract it started with, so a worker dispatched before this cut never heard of the key and keeps the
// per-wait rules. An unknown dispatch instant reads as LEGACY for the same reason — the old rules are the

// bands it below the rule regardless — see inActiveBand. This flag decides nothing for it beyond keeping
// it out of Snoozed.)

// exactly this field — foreign rows never section, and the server clears needsYou on an archived row),

// upstream excusal remembering to band its own threads.
//

// second half was left to the SERVER: a thread it excused from the queue was expected to be either Snoozed
// or visibly alive (`awaitingBackground`, which is what puts a shell-only or CI-holding rest in this
// band). Every excusal that forgot dropped its thread into the cue with nothing behind it — a row that
// looks queued, has no card, and opens a DRAWER on click instead of scrolling to one. Reported
// 2026-07-29 on a snoozed shell-only rest ("there's no card for it in the UI — when I click it, it opens
// it in a drawer") and again 2026-08-14 on a stale delivery ledger, which is a queue excusal with no
// banding of its own at all (board.ts hasFreshDelivery). Two different upstream bugs, one symptom,
// because the rule the maintainer actually reads the rail by was never written down here.
//
// A cardless row below the rule states the truth in every case that reaches it: the human has nothing to
// answer, and something — a child, a shell, CI, a follow-up in flight — is between this thread and its

// watcher hands over whatever was already sitting there (maintainer 2026-08-12, choosing this over a
// card that merely mentions it). A worker had parked on colinhacks/zod#6318 saying "waiting on review"
// with two unread reviews already on it, and the old baseline recorded them as handled — so the watcher
// slept on the very thing it was watching for.
//
// It rides as a derived TAIL on the ordinary burst shape rather than a third header, for the reason the
// parser documents below: an unrecognized line under the header is DROPPED, so every already-open tab
// renders this card exactly as before. A new header shape would have made them all fall back to prose.
//
// `backlog` is deliberately NOT a GithubWakeSteer field — it is an argument. Putting it in the schema
// would break the parse round-trip (the parser cannot recover it from the text), and that round-trip is
// the contract that keeps formatter and parser from drifting.

/** Is this delivered steer the FIRST-PARK REPLAY rather than news?
 *
 *  The chat needs to tell them apart, because they read as opposite things: activity that landed while
 *  the worker was parked is an event, and a PR's pre-existing history is not (maintainer 2026-08-13:
 *  "That already is preexisting on the PR, which I find quite weird… For PRs that have been around for a
 *  long time, it's going to render like a hundred reviews").
 *
 *  Matched on the TAIL rather than carried in `GithubWakeSteer`, which keeps the formatter's round-trip
 *  intact — see the note above on why `backlog` is an argument and not a field. A legacy transcript
 *  written before the tail existed simply reads as not-a-backlog, which is what it was. */
