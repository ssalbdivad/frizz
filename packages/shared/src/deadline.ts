// A THREAD'S DEADLINE — the time limit a prompt carries (plans/time-limits.md).
//
// A thread may carry one absolute instant by which its worker owes the best deliverable it can hand
// over, rather than the complete one eventually. The human sets it when dispatching ("2h", "15:30") or
// later from the drawer; a worker may set one on a thread that has none. Frizz reminds the worker at
// fixed points in the budget, mid-turn, and the board shows the countdown and then the overrun.
//
// IT IS SOFT, and that is settled, not pending: running out of time never interrupts a turn and never
// stops a sub-agent, because the agent completion invariant forbids cutting a writer off mid-edit. The
// limit is enforced by what the agent is told and by the board showing the thread over time.
//
// What lives HERE is what the browser and the server both read: parsing what the human typed, the stage
// instants, and the "42m left" reading. The worker-facing text lives in the server (deadline.ts there).
