// THE EDITOR BRIDGE — the wire between Frizz and an editor extension (packages/vscode) running in a
// VS Code, Cursor or Windsurf window. Design and rationale: plans/vscode-extension.md.
//
// One WebSocket per editor WINDOW, opened BY the extension to the one machine-wide endpoint
// `/_frizz/editor` (never per project: a window's folders can span several projects, and the server
// is a singleton). Over it the extension says which folders it has open, whether it has focus, and —
// for the agents to read — what its editor shows (`editor`, below);
// the server sends it files to open and folders to raise, and the projects its folders belong to with
// their queue counts. Everything else the extension does — dispatching a thread, a follow-up — goes
// through the ordinary RPC surface, like any other client.
//
// Pure types and constants, no zod: the extension bundles this module and must not drag the shared
// index in. The zod schemas the SERVER validates frames with live beside ServerEvent in index.ts, and
// are pinned assignable to these types there.
