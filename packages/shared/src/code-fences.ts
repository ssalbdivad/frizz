// Where a markdown text's fenced CODE BLOCKS are, so the scanners that hunt for frizz's own openers
// (```question, ```done, ```awaiting) can ignore the ones a message is merely QUOTING.
//
// Every one of those scanners is a line-anchored regex over raw markdown with no notion of nesting, so
// a worker that documents the protocol — the correct authoring form being a ````-wrapped example around
// a ```question sample — had its sample hoisted OUT into a live answerable card, while the enclosing
// ```` delimiters were left behind as orphan prose that opened an unterminated code block and swallowed
// the rest of the message. Same root cause for a quoted ```done/```awaiting.
//
// Shared (not mirrored by hand in each package) because the web renderer and the server's derived
// pending-question flag must agree about what is a real opener; a divergence here is a thread that
// renders one way and is CLASSIFIED another.
