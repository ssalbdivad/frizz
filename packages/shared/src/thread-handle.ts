// A THREAD'S NAME IS ALSO ITS HANDLE (David 2026-09-29: "I want the displayed names to also be
// camelCase so its obvious how to refer to them and that they represent ids"). The handle was camelCase
// until 2026-09-30, when the maintainer switched it to KEBAB-case: it is how the names developers already
// type after `#`/`@` are spelled (Slack channels, repos, branches, npm packages, URL slugs — and this
// thread's own slug), it reads as a name rather than a code identifier, and it needs no Shift.
//
// A name is stored as the one or two words it was minted as ("Shell budgets", "ArkType perf") — the
// server's namer, the worker's `title` tool and a human rename all write words — and it is SHOWN as the
// kebab-case handle those words make (`shell-budgets`, `arktype-perf`). What the operator reads on the board
// is therefore exactly what they type after `@` to point one thread at another ("ask @shell-budgets about
// this"), and what a worker passes to `read_thread` / `message_thread`.
//
// Resolution never depends on the casing: a handle is matched by folding case, punctuation and spacing
// away (the server's `foldThreadName`), so `@shellbudgets`, `@shell-budgets` and `@ShellBudgets` all name
// the same thread — so a camelCase handle written before the switch still resolves. Both sides fold the
// handle with its punctuation removed, so `dev-ops` and `devOps` are both the one word "devops" to the
// plural strip (server thread-mentions.ts, web threadMentions.ts `foldHandle`).

// A name's HANDLE is also what the operator TYPES after `@`, so two words are not enough of a bound on
// their own — every writer but a human rename also holds the handle to this length (server
// thread-names.ts `threadNameProblem`): "Spinoff feature scope and UI" went onto the board as
// `@spinoffFeatureScopeAndUi`, 24 characters nobody wants to type even with autocomplete (maintainer
// 2026-09-29). The cap was sixteen for camelCase; each kebab hyphen spends a character the camel hump did
// not, so it rose to twenty with the switch — enough for every good name on the board that day
// (`background-shells`, 17) while `spinoff-feature-scope-and-ui` (28) is still refused.
