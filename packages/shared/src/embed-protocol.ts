// THE SIDEBAR EMBED — the wire between the VS Code extension's Frizz sidebar (packages/vscode/src/sidebar.ts)
// and the real Frizz page it frames (packages/web/src/lib/embed.ts). Design and rationale:
// plans/vscode-extension.md § The sidebar.
//
// Three documents take part: the extension host (Node), the webview document VS Code serves from a
// `vscode-webview://` origin (a relay script and nothing else), and the Frizz page in an iframe of it,
// at the origin the extension discovered (`http://127.0.0.1:<port>`). The relay passes these messages
// through unchanged, in both directions, and checks where each one came from:
//
//  - page → host: the relay forwards only what arrives from ITS iframe (`event.source ===
//    frame.contentWindow`) at Frizz's origin; the extension validates the shape again and acts only on
//    what it knows (an unknown type is ignored, a URL that is not http(s) or mailto is refused, a key
//    chord runs a command only if the extension's own allowlist names it).
//  - host → page: the relay posts with `targetOrigin` = Frizz's origin, so selected code is never handed
//    to a document from anywhere else; the page accepts host messages only from `window.parent`.
//
// Nothing here goes through the Frizz server: a selection reaches the sidebar's composer directly, so the
// server's held-item path (`compose` → `composeTake`, claimed by whichever page has focus) stays what it is
// for browser tabs, and the sidebar never races a tab — or the human's own typing — for an item.
//
// Pure types and constants, no zod: the extension bundles this module, and so does the page.

 * (`EMBED_COLOR_VALUE`), and sets each as a custom property on its own root — never a selector, never a
