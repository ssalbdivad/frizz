/**
 * The wire between a board and the relay that fronts it.
 *
 * A board dials OUT to the relay and keeps one WebSocket open. Every visitor request for that board's
 * hostname is then framed down that socket and answered back up it, so the board needs no inbound
 * port, no tunnel binary, and no DNS record of its own — which is the whole reason this exists. One
 * wildcard record serves every name instead of one record per user.
 *
 * DEPENDENCY-FREE, like claim.ts and for the same reason: the board runs this on Node and the relay
 * runs it on workerd.
 *
 * WHAT THIS HAS TO CARRY, and why a plain request/response relay would be useless for Frizz: the board
 * is mostly a live surface. Its event feed is SSE and its terminals are WebSockets. So the protocol
 * frames three things, not one — a unary request, a STREAMED response body, and a nested WebSocket.
