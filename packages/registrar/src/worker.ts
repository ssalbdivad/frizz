 * every repository its owner can, and a compromised build of this Worker collected them. The CLI now
 * signs in through Frizz's own OAuth App, which asks for no scopes, so its token can read only the
 * public profile. Two checks hold every client to that, an old one above all:
 *
 * - The shape, BEFORE GitHub is asked anything: an OAuth App user token is `gho_…`. A classic PAT
 *   (`ghp_`), a fine-grained one (`github_pat_`) or a GitHub App token (`ghu_`, `ghs_`) is not what
 *   the CLI mints, and their powers are not all visible in the header below, so they are refused unread.
 * - The scopes: GitHub lists an OAuth token's scopes in `X-OAuth-Scopes` on every API answer. Any scope
 *   at all — `gh` holds `repo`, `workflow`, `read:org`, `gist` — refuses the claim. An empty or absent
 *   header is a token with no scopes.
