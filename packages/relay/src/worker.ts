/**
 * The relay: one wildcard hostname in front of every board.
 *
 * `*.frizz.sh` resolves here. A board dials in over a WebSocket and holds it open; a visitor's request
 * for that board's hostname is routed to the Durable Object holding that socket and framed down it.
 * No per-user DNS record and no per-user tunnel, which is what removes the 200-name ceiling the
 * tunnel design could never get past.
 *
 * WE ARE ON THE DATA PATH HERE, unlike the registrar. That is the trade this design makes deliberately:
 * unlimited names cost us the traffic. The visitor still meets Frizz's own single-use access gate on
 * the far side, but every byte passes through here in plaintext — the access code as it is redeemed,
 * the session cookie on every request after it, prompts, transcripts and terminal keystrokes. So
 * whoever controls this Worker controls every board behind it: between 2026-09-21 and 2026-10-08 a
 * stolen Cloudflare token was used to deploy a build of this file that copied all of that out and
 * drove a board with a copied cookie. Deploys go through CI only (packages/relay/README.md), and
 * plans/blind-relay.md is the design that takes the plaintext away from this hop.
