// Browser QA for the two boxes a reply to a thread is typed into: THE STANDARD PROMPT BOX in the thread
// drawer (components/ThreadComposerBox.tsx, under ThreadActionBar) and the reply box of the page's QUEUE
// CARD (components/AllQueuesCard.tsx ReplyBox). Two things are proven here, both of which have differed
// between the surfaces:
//
//   D7 — `/login` and `/logout` are FRIZZ-OWNED aliases. They must open the sign-in / sign-out modal and
//        must NEVER be delivered to the worker's stdin. Before the box was shared this only worked in
//        the drawer; the board's queue card injected the literal "/login" string into the running agent.
//        It happened AGAIN with the board's deletion (2026-09-28): the page's card had its own send path
//        with no alias check, and ReplyBox now intercepts through `parseAccountAlias` itself.
//   D8 — an ordinary follow-up still reaches the worker.
//
// The REAL ThreadActionBar / ThreadComposerBox and AllQueuesCard render; only the network is stubbed.
// Every followUp the app attempts — unprefixed from the drawer, `/_frizz/<project id>/rpc/followUp` from
// the card, which addresses its own project — is recorded on window.__worker.sent. That array IS the
// worker's stdin as far as this fixture is concerned, so "the alias never reached the worker" is a
// direct assertion, not an inference.
//
//   ?surface=drawer (default) — the drawer footer (ThreadActionBar)
//   ?surface=card             — the page's queue card for the same thread
//   ?surface=both             — both, side by side (the comparison screenshot). They share the thread
//                               and so its draft, so a test drives one surface at a time.
//   ?answerable=1             — the agent's last message carries a ```question block (layout check)
//
// The card mounted here until 2026-09-28 was the board's (TodosView); the one mounted now is the page's,
// under a MemoryRouter with a QueuesProject, the way registered-question-fixture.tsx mounts it.
