// Browser QA for the space UNDER a rendered PICTURE card — the one card in the transcript that is a big
// visual mass rather than a one-line band (maintainer 2026-08-11, on an image `Read` followed by the
// live shimmer: "we need better spacing under the screenshots … it's too close").
//
// The picture card is a tool-activity EXCEPTION (lib/toolActivity), so every spacing predicate used to
// see "a card" and charge the tight run's 6px — the pitch that exists to erase the seam between two
// compact bands. Under a picture that pitch glues the next row to the frame's bottom edge.
//
// The picture card is a SendUserFile delivery now, drawn open as a gallery. An image `Read` was one
// until 2026-10-03, when the maintainer folded every picture a tool merely returned into the collapsed
// digest ("No images or screenshots are visible unless you make them visible to the user with the light
// box"); `?case=folded` pins that it is an ordinary label row now, spaced like one.
//
// The GAPS are readable on a plain Vite dev server — they are decided by the tool's `sentImages`
// field, not by whether the bytes arrived (pictureSpacing.e2e.test.ts asserts them there). To SEE the
// frames, the picture has to load, and `/local-image` is not something Vite serves: run
// `scripts/adhoc-stack.mjs`, proxy `/_frizz` at it from the Vite server, and pass `?shot=<abs path>` to
// a real PNG under a trusted root (the OS temp dir is one). Without that, the gallery lists its path as
// text — which is honest, but it is not the mass this page exists to judge.
//
//   ?case=shimmer (default) — picture → the live shimmer. The reported shape.
//   ?case=folded            — an image `Read` → the live shimmer: a folded label row, no picture in sight.
//   ?case=cards             — two pictures stacked, then an ordinary tool band. The pitch BETWEEN
//                             pictures, and out of one into a compact band.
//   ?case=prose             — picture → assistant prose, which already took the full step.
//   ?case=prose-picture     — the two ways a worker EMBEDS a shot in its own prose, in one message: a
//                             Markdown `![](…)` and a bare absolute PATH. They must render as ONE
//                             object (see ImageFrame), so both keep the PROSE rhythm — the picture step
//                             is for the tool CARD, which is its own transcript object rather than part
//                             of the sentence introducing it. This page is where that is checked.
//   ?case=control           — the SAME shapes with no picture in them: two background-op cards batched,
//                             then the shimmer. Both must still sit at the tight run, which is what
//                             proves PICTURE_STEP is charged to pictures and not to every exception.
//   ?font=mono              — the other type family (lib/font.ts owns this attribute in the real app).
