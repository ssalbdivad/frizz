// THE GOAL AS A LOOP: its run counter and limits, in the one short phrase the thread header's facts line
// shows after the goal mark (ThreadHeaderFacts; it rode in the lifecycle footer from 2026-09-29 until that
// footer went). A Goal with limits is a bounded loop, and the question an operator asks of one at a glance
// is "how far through is it, and when does it end" — so the line answers it without a click: `run 7 of 20`, `run 7`, `run 3 of 20 · 1h 12m left`, and once it has ended, why.
//
// Nothing for a Goal that is neither counting toward anything nor has anything to say: an unbounded Goal
// that has not delivered yet, or one switched off by hand. A reading with nothing in it is noise.
//
// Durations are the house grammar (`2h 35m`, durationLabels.ts); the bound itself reads back in the
// `for:` token it was written as (`2h`), because that is the value the operator typed.
