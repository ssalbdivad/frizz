// them back — 1.0-1.3s after the drawer was in the DOM at a load average of ~6 (2026-09-29, probed with
// the browser's own `startViewTransition` promises). The previous page's writer is gone with it, so an
// Escape in that window closed the drawer and wrote nothing; the route then applied the drawer's address,
