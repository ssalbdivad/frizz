// where the hook throws. The route tree registers its navigate here (routes.tsx, both shells) and
// leaves call there; with nothing registered (a bare test render) it falls back to a document load,
// which is what the underlying <a href> would have done anyway.
// `viewTransition` rides through to react-router's navigate, which wraps the route swap in
// `document.startViewTransition` where the browser has it and falls back to an instant swap where it
// doesn't. Both halves of the fullscreen door pass it today; react-router re-arms
// it on its own for the browser-Back POP of a pair that transitioned.
