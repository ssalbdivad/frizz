// REVIEW CHANGES — everything a thread changed, as the editor's multi-file diff against where it started
// (plans/vscode-extension.md § Reviewing a thread's changes). Claude Code and Cursor show an agent's edits
// as native diffs; a Frizz worker edits files directly, often in a worktree of its own, so here the
// review is of what is on disk, opened in the editor where the human can fix what they see in place.
//
// WHERE IT IS OFFERED, and why only there. The diff is the EDITOR's (the Frizz extension's), so the action
// exists only where one can show it:
//   - in the editor's sidebar (embed mode), always: the page names the thread to its host
//     (`frizz:review`), which asks Frizz for what it changed and opens the diff in THAT window;
//   - in a browser tab, while an editor window that can review is connected (`reviews` on the window
//     summary — an extension from before the feature never says it can): Frizz pushes the review to the
//     window that has the thread's checkout open, which opens it and comes to the front. The label names
//     that editor, because the click leaves the browser.
// No editor connected, no item: an in-browser diff is a different feature, and an item that could only
// say "connect an editor" is a dead end in a menu.
