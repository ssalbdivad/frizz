/**
 * A follow-up into a thread of ANY project, named by id — delivered the way the board's composer delivers
 * one: a refusal the server PROVED took no effect (runtime contention, a permission or model change
 * mid-flight, a control-plane restart) is waited out and retried under the same delivery id, which the
 * server's ledger dedupes; each attempt is bounded, so a hung request cannot hold the caller.
 *
 * Everything's cards (AllQueuesCard.tsx) and its project list's rows (Sidebar.tsx ThreadRow's Retry, under
 * a ThreadProjectScope) both send through here, because on that page the thread is usually not the page
 * project's and the page's own eager follow-up would address the wrong server.
