// WHAT THE PROMPT BOX MAKES OF ITS WORDS, AND WHAT ENTER DOES WITH THEM (plans/schedule-live-reading.md). There is
// one submit — Enter, the send button, the phone's send — and the model decides what it means: a prompt with a
// schedule word in it is read (lib/scheduleReadScheduler.ts), and if the model says the words ask for the work
// to REPEAT, Enter creates that schedule instead of starting the thread. Everything here is pure, so the
// decisions are tested without a DOM (scheduleIntent.test.ts) and ScheduleComposer.tsx only executes them.
//
// The rules:
//   - A reading is used at submit only for EXACTLY the text being submitted (its trimmed words), never one read
//     from an earlier text: an edit since the last read is re-read before anything is created. A reading the
//     cache holds costs nothing to re-use, so nothing relocates an old reading onto new words.
//   - Enter never waits on the model. Without a reading for the text, the words leave the box at once and their
//     reading settles them in the background (`settleAct`): a schedule is created and a toast says which, anything
//     else starts the thread. Until 2026-10-07 Enter HELD in the box until the answer landed (maintainer: "change
//     checking for a schedule so that it doesnt delay submitting the prompt").
//   - Nothing is ever dispatched silently in place of a schedule the human may have meant: a read that fails or
//     times out, or a schedule the box cannot make, starts the thread with a toast that says why.
//   - The human can say "not a schedule" (× or Esc): the draft keeps that phrase DISMISSED, and Enter starts the
//     thread, until the model reads a different phrase out of the words. Said over a strip that is still the
//     reading of EARLIER words, it is about the words on screen, and takes their reading's phrase when it lands.
//   - A reading of other words never looks current: kept on screen while its words are read again, it is marked
//     as updating, and the send wears ↻ only while that read is out or due.
