// THE TAB'S OWN REST MARK: a dot on the favicon of a /full tab whose thread is in the queue (maintainer
// 2026-09-19: "a little indicator should pop up in the favicon when a full-screen view tab is at
// rest"), and a COUNT on the page's tab — how many cards its queue holds, in one project's view or
// All projects alike (maintainer 2026-09-30: "more detailed favicon changes e.g. for the number of
// waiting threads instead of just a binary"). The count is what the retired project sidebar's badges
// said per project; with one tab per project, the tab strip is that sidebar. Several tabs are usually
// open at once and a tab strip shows a favicon and a few characters of title, so the favicon is the
// only place a background tab can say "this many are waiting on you" without being opened.
//
// DRAWN, NOT SHIPPED. The badged icon is the real favicon rasterized onto a canvas with the dot
// composited over it, so there is no second copy of the art to regenerate when the logo changes (the
// index.html `?v=` bump is the whole procedure, and this reads the href that bump produced). An SVG
// that wraps the favicon in an <image> is not an option: an SVG loaded AS an image fetches no
// external resources.

// 64px is 4x a tab's 16 CSS px, so the raster survives a dsf-2 tab strip and the pinned-tab size
// without the browser upscaling it.
const SIZE = 64
// The dot's geometry in that 64px space. At a tab's 16px: a 6px dot inside a 1px clear ring, which is
// what separates it from the tile on ANY tab-strip colour — the ring is punched out to transparency
// rather than painted, because the strip behind it is the browser theme's and cannot be known.
const DOT_RADIUS = 12
const RING = 4
// TOP RIGHT (maintainer 2026-09-19: "I feel like it should be in the top right") — where a notification
// badge sits on every icon the eye already knows. The mark has 180-degree rotational symmetry, so no
// corner covers less ink than another and the choice is convention alone. Inset so the ring's outer
// edge lands exactly on the canvas edge instead of being clipped flat.
const DOT_X = SIZE - DOT_RADIUS - RING
const DOT_Y = DOT_RADIUS + RING
// NOT the accent, though the accent is what says "attention" everywhere else. The mark itself is drawn
// in the accent's gold, so at 16px a gold dot reads as one more loop of the logo; the badge has to
// differ from the art in HUE to register as a badge at all. Compared at tab size on Chrome's four
// stock strip colours (favicon-badge-fixture.html): gold merged into the mark, --color-fg vanished on
// the light strips, red read as an error. This is the palette's azure (--color-shell), borrowed for
// its hue alone — a canvas cannot resolve a CSS variable, and a tab strip has no shell vocabulary.
const DOT_COLOR = "#4a9eff"

// THE COUNT'S PILL, in the same 64px space. It has to carry a digit, so it is bigger than the dot, but it
// must leave the logo readable: 44px tall (11 tab px) covered the whole mark (maintainer 2026-09-30: "the
// number needs to be smaller and/or more top right aligned so it doesnt cover the whole logo"). 34px is
// 8.5 tab px, a bold digit inking ~6px, and the pill sits FLUSH in the corner — its own edge on the
// canvas edge, the clear ring surviving only on the two sides that face the tile, which are the only
// sides it separates anything from. Past MAX_COUNT it reads "9+" in a smaller face.
const PILL_HEIGHT = 34
const PILL_RING = 3
const MAX_COUNT = 9
// Azure is too light for white type (2.9:1), and the dot's own hue is what says "badge" here; this is the
// same azure darkened until white on it clears 4.5:1, so the numeral is the pill's contrast, not its ring.
