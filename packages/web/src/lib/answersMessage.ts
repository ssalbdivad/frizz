// Detect + parse OUR OWN composed-answer format, so a user message that is a multi-block answer renders
// as a structured card (echoing the question component) instead of a flat run-on bubble. The format is
// produced by useLiveAnswering.sendAnswers for a message with >1 question block:
//
//   Answers:
//   1. <answer one>
//   2. <answer two>
//   …
//
// — for EVERY live-ask send, a one-block ask included (see composeAnswerWire). Detection is deliberately
// strict: the FIRST non-empty line must be exactly "Answers:", and the body must be numbered "N. …"
// lines. Anything else returns null and the caller falls back to the plain bubble — degrade safely,
// never lose text.
//
// composeAnswerWire has a SECOND form for a batch that answers a BURIED ask (see parseBuriedAnswersMessage):
//
//   Answers to earlier questions:
//   1. “<question>” → <answer>
//   2. <child arrow> “<follow-up question>” → <answer>
//
// which carries its own questions inline and so needs no lookback pairing at all. `parseAnswersCard`
// is the entry point that accepts either.
//
// THAT SECOND FORM HAS A THIRD WRITER, and it is the one this file's shape now has to serve: an answer to
// a REGISTERED question (`mcp__frizz__ask`), composed on the SERVER by questionAnswerMessage because the
// human may have answered while the worker's process was down. It arrives as a frizz WAKE rather than as
// a message the browser sent, and the only thing that makes it read as the human's own answer instead of
// a notification card is that it is written in this form (see Message, which checks for it first). The
// marked rows are that path's: its questions can be a static TREE, which is flat on the wire.

/** WHAT THE IN-FLIGHT ANSWER CARD STILL HAS TO SAY — the rows of `wire` that no message in the
 *  transcript is already drawing. Null when there is nothing left for it to add.
 *
 *  The board hands every surface `answersInFlight`: the answer the human has already sent, composed from
 *  the registry, drawn dimmed at the tail so the seconds before the worker has it are not a hole (see
 *  board.answersInFlight). It is spent by the worker RECEIVING the answer — the newest USER record — and
 *  that is deliberately later than the delivery being handed to a channel.
 *
 *  But the transcript reaches the same bytes FIRST. Frizz's delivery lands in the worker's own queue the
 *  moment it is injected, and Claude Code writes a `queue-operation enqueue` for it — which the transcript
 *  renders as a queued bubble, i.e. as this very Answers card, while `lastUserAt` has not moved because no
 *  user record exists yet. So for the whole length of the turn that was in flight (minutes on a loaded
 *  machine) the human saw their own answer TWICE, in two identical dimmed cards, one in the transcript and
 *  one pinned above the composer (reported 2026-09-01, with a screenshot of both). The same overlap opens
 *  a shorter way whenever a transcript push simply beats the board push that spends the row.
 *
 *  The transcript's copy is the one at its true place in the conversation, so it wins and the pinned card
 *  stands down. Row-wise rather than whole-message, because the board composes ONE message from every
 *  unspent row while the scheduler delivers per BATCH: two answers given in two clicks can be half
 *  delivered, and then the card's job is the half that is not on screen yet — not all of it, and not none. */
