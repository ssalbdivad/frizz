// ── THE CHILD-OPERATION ROW VOCABULARY ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Four surfaces list a thread's CHILD operations — the sidebar rail's sub-agent rows, a queue card's
// live child lines, the drawer's background-ops strip, and the completion-hold dialog. All four render
// the SAME row (an arrow, a liveness mark, a label), and all four were written independently. They
// drifted exactly as duplicated layout always does: two arrow alphas (/45 and /40 — six pixels apart
// on a single queue card, which is how the maintainer caught it), two stale-dot alphas (/30 and /25 at
// the same size with the same tooltip), and three different answers for an id-less child.
//
// These tokens are the ONE source for that vocabulary and `components/ChildOpRow.tsx` is the ONE
// renderer. Nothing else in the web sources may spell the glyph out again — `subAgentArrow.test.ts`
// fails the build if any rendered literal escapes this file.

// U+2937 ARROW POINTING DOWNWARDS THEN CURVING RIGHTWARDS — the one "branches from its parent" glyph,
// established by the sidebar's sub-agent rows and now shared verbatim by every child surface.
export const CHILD_ARROW = "⤷"

// /45, not /40. Two alphas were live at once; the rail (which established the glyph) and the queue card
// used /45, the ops strip and the completion dialog /40. The arrow is the row's STRUCTURAL marker — the
// thing that says "this line hangs off the one above it" — so it takes the brighter of the two rather
// than sitting below the muted label it introduces.
export const CHILD_ARROW_CLASS = "shrink-0 text-[11px] leading-none text-muted-45"

// THE KIND TAG on an operations row — `AGENT` / `SHELL` / `WATCH` on ChildOpRow's sheet density, `File` /
// `Link` on ThreadLinks. One class, because the two surfaces render one under the other beneath the
// prompt box and the eye runs down ONE label column: the tag's SIZE (9.5px petite caps) and its COLUMN
// (`.frizz-kind-tag` in styles.css — a fixed, per-font width) are what put every label at the same x.
// The saved-reference rows had a 9px tag of their own in a 33px column, which put their labels 14.1px
// right of the rows above them in mono and 7.2px in sans (maintainer 2026-09-11: "The label is further
// to the right. Why? There's no reason for that at all").
export const CHILD_KIND_TAG_CLASS = "frizz-kind-tag petite-caps shrink-0 text-[9.5px] text-muted-45"

// THE MARK SLOT between the arrow and the tag — 9px, the liveness dot plus its halo — on the same two
// surfaces. A saved-reference row puts its 1em icon in this same slot (it overflows by 1.25px a side,
// into the row's 6px gaps) rather than in a wider one of its own, for the same reason: the slot's width
// is part of where the label starts.
export const CHILD_MARK_SLOT_CLASS = "flex w-[9px] shrink-0 justify-center"

// outlier and read as a smudge next to the same dot one surface over.

export const CHILD_STALE_TITLE = "stale — no recent output"

// A RESTED child: its run ended (the harness reported completed/failed) while the fan-out IT dispatched
// is still running. A HOLLOW dot of the same 1.5-unit geometry as the stale one — same box, same
// baseline, so nothing on the row shifts — because the reading is "this one stopped" while the rows
// indented beneath it are still pulsing. It is deliberately not the stale dot: stale means "probably
// still working, just quiet", and the action here is the opposite one (steer it, or its children's work
// is stranded).

export const CHILD_RESTED_TITLE = "rested — it stopped, but the work it launched is still running"

// A tracked background shell/Monitor is a LIVE process even when quiet (its entry only clears on a
// terminal notification), so it breathes rather than showing the flat stale dot — and says so.
export const CHILD_QUIET_SHELL_TITLE = "running — no recent output"

// There is deliberately NO "finished" glyph in this vocabulary. Every mark here means the child is in
// some state of being ALIVE — running, quiet, or stopped-with-live-descendants — so a completed one is
// marked by the ABSENCE of a mark (maintainer 2026-08-01: "remove the status indicator entirely for a
// sub-agent or background shell that has completed"). A static done-dot existed for one commit and was
// removed: it put a mark on nearly every row of a settled transcript while saying nothing the row's own

// Agent SDK's typed task stream, so both are absent for a codex child or an older CLI
// — the row must read fine without them, never leave a gap where one would have been.

// to retire it. WHICH rows may carry it is a property of the ROW (a direct child with an id — see
// lib/dismissChildOp.ts), never of the surface it happens to be rendered on.
//
// The copy is per-STATE, because the × does two different honest things and must claim only the one it
// will actually do. This is the second half of the maintainer's 2026-07-30 ruling — first "the X button

//              the descendants too (router.ts stopSubAgentSubtree). Under-claiming a destructive scope
//              is the same failure as over-claiming one — the operator has to know what the × takes.
//   STALE / RESTED — nothing is running to stop. The × retires a finished op from tracking, which is
//              the phantom escape hatch it was built for, so it says "clear" and promises nothing more.

//
// A child is worth showing while it is live OR stale — "stale" is not "gone", it is "running, but we
// have not seen output in a while", still unresolved work hanging off the thread. The card USED to show
// running-only, so a stale sub-agent vanished from its handoff card while the rail still dimmed it and
// the drawer still listed it — the same cross-surface inconsistency the shared row was built to end
// (maintainer ruling 2026-07-24: unify the card onto the rail's policy). Now:
//
//   card  — running OR stale OR rested. Same set as the rail, minus the rail's id requirement: an
//           id-less child still renders (non-interactive), never silently dropped.
//   rail  — the same set, and only children carrying an `id` (its rows are always drill-in targets;
//           an id-less child from an old snapshot shape has nothing to open, so the rail omits it).
//   sheet — no filter at all. Everything the board reports gets a row.
//
// `rested` joins the visible set for the same reason `stale` did, only more so: the server emits it ONLY
// for a child that still has running work under it (see anchorRoots in tailer.ts), so hiding it would
// hide the live grandchildren indented beneath it — which is exactly the disappearance this vocabulary
// keeps having to fix.

// SUB-AGENT drawer's prompt box has to list only what hangs off THAT child — otherwise a drawer opened
// on one branch would advertise its siblings' work as its own.
//
// The board already carries the tree: every descendant row names its dispatcher in `parentId` (absent
// at depth 1, where the thread itself is the parent). This walks it from `rootId` down, depth-first, so
// the rows come out in the reading order the flat list already uses.
//
// `displayDepth` is a SEPARATE reading from `depth`, and the distinction is load-bearing. `depth` stays
// the row's true distance from the THREAD — `childOpDismisser` keys the × off it (a descendant's
// dispatch lives in an ancestor's transcript, so retiring it by id is a no-op) and re-basing it would
// hand every direct child of this sub-agent an × that silently does nothing. `displayDepth` is purely

// transcript-native and the older board telemetry reports none for them). A Claude shell shows up in

//
// It used to reconcile on label + startedAt, and that key does not hold. The board's instant is the
// tool_use RECORD's timestamp; the transcript's is the projected MESSAGE's — and an assistant turn whose
// prose lands before its call makes them differ by seconds. Measured on the launch the maintainer caught
// (nub session ccc520d9, 2026-07-31): three records share one message id at 19:11:27.256 (thinking),
// 19:11:28.190 (text) and 19:11:32.200 (the Bash tool_use). The message keeps the FIRST rendered
// record's instant, so the two rows carried startedAt four seconds apart, rendered the identical label
// and identical "8m" duration, and the strip drew both — one clickable, one not.
//
// So the LAUNCH ID is the key: `shellId` off the transcript card is by construction the same tool_use id
// the tailer tracks the shell under. Label+startedAt survives only as the fallback for a transcript from
// a pre-restart server that ships no `shellId` — matching there is better than the duplicate.
