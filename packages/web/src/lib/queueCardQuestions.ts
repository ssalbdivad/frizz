// WHERE A QUEUE CARD DRAWS ITS QUESTIONS WHILE IT SHOWS THE HANDOFF — the rest each was asked at, read
// off the thread's transcript with the drawer's own readers.
//
// The card opens on the handoff, not the transcript (AllQueuesCard): the human's last turn as their bubble,
// the reply to it when wakes rested after it (`answer`), and the newest rest (`text`) — router.ts
// handoffOf. Until 2026-10-06 it drew every open question under that newest rest, which is the bug upstream
// fixed in e157817a: a question asked two rests ago, under a newest rest that says nothing about it, read
// as that rest's sign-off — the "pending questions supersede how the agent actually signed off" report
// (Colin 2026-10-05, upstream e157817a) — and it hid the bare rest's own card, "Reply to continue"
// (RestedCard), which a bare rest is owed (22084580).
//
// The position is the DRAWER'S, computed by the same readers ChatView uses — questionAnchor's
// questionsByAnchor (the rest that asked it, or a later one whose fence claims it under `questions:`, or
// the rest that kept it), questionShadow's placeQuestions (a placement marker) and placedFrom (a marker in a
// message the surface does not draw gives the card back to its anchor), and settledQuestions for an
// answered one — over the transcript the card reads for exactly this. This module only maps those message
// positions onto the three places a handoff has room for, the way upstream's card flushes its groups
// through a windowed transcript (TodosView flushQuestions):
//
//   • ABOVE — a rest older than the human's last turn. Upstream flushes these first, above the window, and
//     so does the card: above the human's bubble, since everything after that bubble is newer. It is the
//     common place for a question the human typed past, which the card does not draw at all (see the
//     caller: a set-aside question holds nothing, and is answerable where it was asked).
//   • BETWEEN — a rest after the human's turn that is not the newest: the rest the `answer` prose is the
//     reply of, or one the handoff skips (a wake's reply). It draws under the answer prose, over the newest.
//   • TAIL — the newest rest: under the handoff, where the card's stack has always been.
//
// A MARKER PLACES A CARD AT ITS REST'S END on this view, not mid-prose. The handoff's prose is clamped
// behind "Show more" (AllQueuesCard ClampedBody), and a question drawn inside the clamp is an ask the human
// cannot see without a click; the drawer honours the marker's exact slot. The marker still decides WHICH
// rest the card belongs to, which is the part that moves it.
//
// An answered question owes nothing, so it is never hoisted ABOVE (upstream draws a settled card only
// inside its window), and the answering state's own greyed copy of a question just sent from this card is
// the caller's to subtract (RegisteredQuestionStack keepAnswered draws that one in its slot).
