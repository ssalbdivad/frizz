// FEEDBACK FOR A SLOW OPEN OUTSIDE FRIZZ — an editor on a thread's folder, a file in the Local file links app.
// The window can take seconds to appear (VS Code over WSL routinely does), and until 2026-09-30 nothing
// on the page moved in between: a press looked like a miss, so it got pressed again, and every press
// opened another window.
//
// So each open shows an "Opening …" spinner the moment it is asked for, and it KEEPS spinning until the
// RPC answers — which the server holds until the opener's launcher has handed the path off and exited
// (local-file.ts awaitOpenerHandoff), i.e. until the window is up. Then the spinner simply goes: the
// window is the confirmation. A failure replaces it with the reason. A repeat of the SAME open (same
// key) while it runs, or within OPEN_COOLDOWN_MS of its answer, re-shows the spinner instead of
// spawning a second opener; a different key opens at once.
