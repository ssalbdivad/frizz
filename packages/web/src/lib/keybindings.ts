// THE KEYBOARD SHORTCUTS — what each one does, what it is bound to out of the box, and the pure
// arithmetic of turning a KeyboardEvent into a binding and back into keycaps. No DOM, no store: the
// runtime that acts on a match lives in keyboardRuntime.ts, the sheet that rebinds them in
// components/KeyboardShortcuts.tsx, and the operator's overrides in prefs.ts.
//
// A LETTER IS ITS ACTION'S INITIAL: `r` reply, `d` mark as done, `s` snooze, `f` fullscreen, `o` open in
// a drawer, `t` a terminal on the thread, `n` new project. One rule is worth more than any single well-chosen key, because it predicts the
// keys nobody has looked up yet, including ones added later (maintainer 2026-09-28: "establish the
// convention in general that each action is associated with its first letter"). Until then Done and
// Snooze were `e` and `h`, borrowed from keyboard-first inboxes: `e` is Gmail's archive and
// Superhuman's and GitHub notifications' Done, `h` is Superhuman's and Linear's snooze. Those help only
// the few who arrive with those tools in their fingers (Gmail ships its shortcuts switched off, and
// its own snooze is `b`), and neither letter says what it does.
//
// Four keys break the rule, each for a reason the rule cannot beat:
//
//   j / k   next / previous        MOVEMENT is placed by position, not by name, like arrows, WASD and
//                                  vi's hjkl: it is pressed fast and by feel, so the pair sits side by
//                                  side under one hand, where the initials n and p are a row apart. It
//                                  is also the most shared single-key pair on the web (Gmail, Linear,
//                                  Superhuman, vim), and ↑/↓ are taken: they scroll the card.
//   c       new thread             Gmail's compose, and create in GitHub, Linear and Jira: kept over
//                                  `n` by the maintainer's call
//   ?       this sheet             a symbol, not a letter: Gmail, GitHub, Linear, X, YouTube
//   →       spinoff                a direction, not a letter: the thread branches off to the side
//
// ⌘/Ctrl CHORDS CANNOT FOLLOW IT. The browser owns ⌘ plus most initials (⌘D bookmarks, ⌘S saves, ⌘J
// opens downloads: BROWSER_CHORDS below), so a chord keeps its platform's convention instead:
//
//   ⌘K      jump to a thread       Linear, Slack, GitHub, Vercel, Raycast (it was already here)
//   ⌘,      settings               every native macOS app, VS Code, Slack
//   ⌘I      thread details         Finder's Get Info; already here, kept so it is listed and rebindable
//
// NOT ⌘N for new thread: it is the browser's new-window chord (App.tsx has the long version).
//
// A NEW ACTION TAKES ITS INITIAL. When two want one letter, the rarer of the two, or the one that undoes
// the other (the way Superhuman's ⇧E marks not done), takes Shift and that letter, so the letter still
// guesses right. keybindings.test.ts fails any single-letter default that is not an initial of its
// label unless it is listed there as one of the exceptions above.
//
// SINGLE KEYS NEVER FIRE WHILE YOU TYPE. A binding with no ⌘/Ctrl is a "plain" key: it is ignored in
// any text field and while a dialog or menu is up, so `d` in a prompt box is the letter d. A ⌘/Ctrl
// chord fires from anywhere, the way ⌘K always has.
