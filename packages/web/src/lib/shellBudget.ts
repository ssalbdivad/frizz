// A BACKGROUND SHELL'S REMAINING BUDGET, as a row reads it — "times out in 45m", "past timeout".
//
// It is a CEILING, never an estimate: the agent picks a generous timeout and the job usually finishes far
// sooner. It read "54m left" until 2026-10-01, which an operator took for a prediction of when the work
// would be done (maintainer: don't say "54 minutes left" if that's a timeout, not an estimate).
//
// A shell ends on a clock only when one was DECLARED (server shell-budget.ts, 2026-09-29): its Bash
// `timeout`, an `extend_shell`, held later by an armed `watch`. The server resolves all three into ONE
// instant, `BgShellView.budgetEndsAt`, with the same function its scheduler enforces with — so this
// reads that instant and never re-derives it. An unbudgeted shell reads NOTHING here: there is no
// default to show, and "no budget" on every dev-server row would be a column of noise. Its age, beside
// it on the row, is what makes a forgotten one visible.
//
// PAST TIMEOUT is its own reading, not "times out in 0s": past the instant the agent has been warned and Frizz
// stops the shell ten minutes later unless it is extended — a state the operator may want to act on.
