// THE READER'S PLACE, carried through the fullscreen door.
//
// A queue card and the /full page draw the same thread, and until now the door threw away everything
// the reader had in front of them: /full mounts its own transcript and scrolls to the END, so someone
// parked at turn 15 of a long card arrived at turn 24 with none of what they were reading still on
// screen (maintainer 2026-09-02: "the contents that are currently visible in the cue card, their
// scroll position is totally lost"). Measured on a 24-turn fixture before this existed: eight messages
// on screen before the click, ZERO of them after it.
//
// So the door notes which message is at the top of the reader's view and how far down the screen it
// sits, and the /full transcript puts that same message back at that same height instead of jumping to
// the tail. The message is named by its `sourceId`, which is the ONE identifier both surfaces already
// stamp on their rows (`data-transcript-source-id`) — the virtualized rows in ChatView, which a drawer
// and /full both render — so no new plumbing is needed on either side to find it again.
//
// It is a one-shot hand-off, not state: the door writes it, the next /full transcript to mount reads it
// and clears it. A module-level slot rather than the valtio store for that reason, and the same shape
// `primeFullscreenReturn` already uses for the reverse leg.

// The other thing the door has to carry. Leaving /full used to go to the board ROOT unconditionally —
// the return arrow did it, and the collapse icon inherited it — which was right for a QUEUED thread,
// whose card sat on that very page. It was wrong for every other thread: those are read through a
// DRAWER, the board root did not mount one, and so the reverse view transition had
// nothing named `thread-chat` to morph into and hard cross-faded instead. Measured on a snoozed
// fixture at seven widths from 767 to 2560: the morph was skipped at every one, and the reader was
// dropped on a board with their thread nowhere on it. (The per-project board went on 2026-09-28; the
// door is now only ever pressed in a drawer, so the address it hands back is always a drawer's.)
//
// The fix is not a new mechanism: the drawer's own url (`/all/<slug>/thread/<t>`) is routed, and
// CrossProjectPage (routes.tsx) re-mounts and names that surface when it is routed to
// (primeFullscreenReturn — the path built for the browser Back button, which is why Back always morphed
// correctly while the button beside it did not). So the door just has to remember the address it was pressed at and hand it back.
//
// One record, not a map: only the most recent door press can be the one being undone, and keying it by
// slug means a stale record can never send the reader to some other thread's surface. It outlives the
// scroll hand-off deliberately — a reader may sit on /full for an hour before collapsing it.
