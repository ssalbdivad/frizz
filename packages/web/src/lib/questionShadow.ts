// ONE QUESTION, ONE CARD — folding a ```question fence into the registered question it restates, and
// taking its POSITION while doing it (see PLACEMENT at the foot of this file: the fence's slot is where
// the registered card renders, so a worker can write the ask into the middle of its own handoff).
//
// A worker can ask the same question twice at one rest: register it with `ask` (a row, the durable
// form) and then, at sign-off, write it again as a ```question fence because the contract says the
// fence is the handback. Both producers reach QuestionBlockCard, so the transcript drew the question
// twice, back to back, on the thread page and the queue card (maintainer 2026-08-28: "Same question
// showing up twice in a row" — a release go/no-go registered at 10:11 and re-fenced at 10:11 with
// "(also on the board as a card)" appended, after two PR-watcher wakes had buried the first fence).
//
// The REGISTERED card is the one that survives, and it is not a coin toss: answering it settles the
// row, which is what un-gates `done` and dequeues the thread; answering the fence sends a plain
// follow-up and leaves the row open behind it, so the worker wakes to an answer it cannot `done` past.
// (lib/registeredDone.ts folds the other way — a fenced done beside a registered one keeps the message's
// card — because there the two are the same bytes and nothing is settled by which one is drawn.)
//
// A fence is folded only when it demonstrably RESTATES a registration standing at the SAME REST. A
// different question fenced beside a registered one still renders — the fold never hides a question
// the human has not seen elsewhere on the page. The text rule is deliberately loose about markup (the
// fence wraps `code` and [links](…) that the registration's plain string cannot carry) and about
// trailing prose (the worker appends a parenthetical), and strict about the question itself.

// ---- PLACEMENT: the marker says WHERE the registered card renders ----
//
// An empty ```question qst_… fence is a PLACEMENT MARKER: the registered card whose id it names renders
// in its slot, so a worker can couch a question inside its own handoff — the setup above it, the card,
// then what happens either way — instead of every card landing at the tail of the rest.
//
// It has been in and out once. Built 2026-08-28 (maintainer: "it's kind of nice that they can couch a
// registered question within some copy"), it placed the rest's WHOLE group at the first standing fence,
// with a text-match fallback for a worker that re-fenced the question in prose. Retired 2026-08-30 on
// usage data (15 of 17 real markers sat at the tail, where the card lands with no marker at all). Back
// on 2026-09-11 for a different reason than couching: the free-form ```question fence — a question
// written INTO a fence body — is retired from the contract outright (shared QUESTION_FENCE_RETIRED_AT),
// because a fence's answer is bytes in a later message that nothing tracks, and settling one means
// guessing (PR #33, declined). The marker is the ONE fence a worker still writes, and it is safe
// precisely because it names a ROW: the row is open or answered, and nothing about the fence is ever
// inferred (maintainer 2026-09-11: "a version of the question fence that just contains a reference to
// a specific registered question. Any question identifier that doesn't show up inside one of these
// question reference fences can just show up at the end").
//
// PLACEMENT IS PER QUESTION, BY ID, AND NOTHING ELSE. One marker places exactly the question it names;
// a rest's other questions render at the anchor as they always did; a marker naming an id that is not
// standing at its message draws nothing (the fold below). The 2026-08-28 text-match placement is NOT
// back: prose that restates a registration still FOLDS (draws nothing, so an old-contract worker's
// re-fenced question is never a second card) but never places, because a fuzzy match is exactly the
// guess the marker exists to remove.
//
// THE ANSWERS STILL SEND AS ONE UNIT. The `answerQuestions` RPC takes every staged answer in one call
// (a per-question send would half-wake the worker), so scattering the cards through the prose cannot
// scatter the Send: the cards share ONE answering state (RegisteredQuestionCards' provider) and the
// rest's stack at the anchor carries the one "Send answers" for all of them, placed or not.
//
// NOTHING IS EVER LOST BY OMISSION. A rest whose message names none of its registrations renders them
// at the anchor exactly as before — the worker chooses the position, never whether the human sees it.
// And the placement is NOT confined to the asking rest: a worker that rests again after the human
// replied past the question writes its marker into THAT handoff, and the marker takes there.
//
// THE SCAN STARTS AT THE NEWEST REST THAT CLAIMS THE QUESTION (2026-10-05) — lib/questionAnchor: the
// rest that asked it, or a later one whose ```awaiting fence names it under `questions:`. A marker in the
// asking handoff therefore keeps the card in that prose for as long as no later rest claims it, which is
// the point: a question stays embedded where the worker couched it, and a later rest that says nothing
// about it leaves it there. A later fence that names it moves it to that rest — into its prose if a
// marker there places it, otherwise under the fence. (From 2026-09-13 the scan instead started at the
// CURRENT rest whenever the thread was at rest, so every marker but the newest handoff's stopped placing
// and every open card fell to the tail — the stacking the maintainer reported on 2026-10-01.)
