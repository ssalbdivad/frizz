// THE EDITOR BESIDE A BROWSER TAB — the quiet line over a tab's prompt boxes (components/EditorLine.tsx)
// that names what the editor next to it has in front: `VS Code: a.ts:12-20`.
//
// WHY A BROWSER TAB GETS ONE. In an editor's sidebar the context bar reads the editor live and every send
// carries what it names (lib/editorContext.ts). A human talking to a thread from a BROWSER TAB beside VS
// Code has neither: the agent learns what is selected only if it decides to call its `editor` tool
// (ARCHITECTURE.md § VS Code extension), and the human cannot see whether there is
// anything for it to read. So the tab names exactly what that tool would read — the server answers from
// the same window the tool does (server editor-bridge.ts `front`) — and a click adds it as a chip, the
// way the sidebar's bar does, for the human who wants it in the message rather than left to the agent.
// It sends nothing on its own: a tab is not where the human is pointing at code, and context they did
// not choose to send from a surface that cannot show them the switch would be context they cannot stop.
//
// Never the text until the click: the line's reading (`editorFront`) carries the file and the selection's
// lines, and the click asks again for the item (`editorFront({ text: true })`), so what crosses into the
// page is what the human chose to add.
//
// LIVE by a payload-free ping (`editor-front`, api/board-stream.ts), which the server sends when what
// some window shows changed; the line then asks its project again (lib/editorBridge.ts editorFrontChanged
// invalidates the query). Not in the sidebar, which has the whole bar, and not on a phone, where no
// editor is beside the human.
