// THE TITLE ROW'S BUTTONS — VS Code's own row above the sidebar's frame carries what a Frizz header would
// (ARCHITECTURE.md § VS Code extension), and each button arrives here as a
// `frizz:command`. Each is the app's own door, called rather than re-implemented, so a button and the key
// or menu item it stands for cannot drift:
//
//   new-thread  `c`'s door (lib/newThreadDoor.ts): the caret in the page's prompt box, or, over an open
//               thread, the new-thread dialog over it.
//   queue       the palette's Queue: every drawer closed, back to the page under them.
//   jump        ⌘K: the palette.
//   settings    ⌘,: Settings.
//   shortcuts   `?`: the keyboard shortcuts sheet, from the row's ⋯ — the status row's ⌨ button is not
//               drawn in the sidebar (StatusRow.tsx).
//   prompt      Ctrl+L / ⌘L in the editor with nothing selected (Cursor's chord to its chat): the caret into
//               the prompt box in front — the New thread dialog's while it is up, else the open thread's
//               reply box, else the page's new-thread box — at the end of what is there, where the human
//               left off. Not a door that opens anything: with a thread open the reply box is the one meant.
//
// A button is pressed in VS Code, not in the frame, so whatever transient layer the page had up (the
// palette, the shortcuts sheet, the picture viewer, a dialog) goes first, as a click outside it would
// have closed it.
//
// ON A THREAD'S /full PAGE the frame has no page under it to go back to: its route is outside the page's,
// with no drawers to close and no prompt box. A frame lands there from a routed address naming a thread
// that has since gone (store.ts resolveRoutedThread) and from that page's locator, and its title row
// offers Back to queue like any thread's — which did nothing (sweep 2026-10-01). There Back goes home, as
// a navigate to the queue does, and New thread goes home and then opens the door.
