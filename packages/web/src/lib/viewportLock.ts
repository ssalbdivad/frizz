// THE SCROLL HALF of "the queue never moves a card the human is looking at" (David 2026-09-28:
// "it needs to be guaranteed that cards that I'm currently viewing on the screen don't move in their
// position"). lib/stableQueue.ts decides the ORDER — nothing is inserted between the cards on screen and
// none of them leaves on its own — which leaves every change either BELOW them, where it moves nothing,
// or ABOVE them, where it moves them in the document. This scrolls by exactly that much, before the
// frame paints, so on screen they have not moved.
//
// WHY NOT THE BROWSER'S OWN SCROLL ANCHORING, which exists to do exactly this: it fails in the places the
// queue puts the reader. Chrome does not anchor at scroll offset 0 — where the first card lands after
// every dismissal and every rail click to it — and it anchors on the first visible node in DOM order,
// which near the top is the READY header, ABOVE the insertion point. Both were probed (a card inserted
// above the reader moved it 840px in each), and FIFO puts the reader on the first card, so its normal
// working position was the one where anchoring never ran. So native anchoring is switched off on the
// document while a queue is on screen, and this does its job in every position.
//
// THE ANCHOR is the card the human is engaged with, in order: the one they are TYPING in (the text box
// itself is held, so the caret does not move — while the box is on screen; one scrolled away from is
// not being typed in), the one under the pointer (they are about to click something in it — until they
// use the keyboard, after which a mouse parked over one card says nothing about the card they are
// reading), else the one at the reading line a third of the way down the viewport (they are reading it). For the last two the card's first node visible from the top of the viewport is held, as
// the browser's own anchoring picks one — never the element under the pointer: a card that grows under
// it ("Show more", its own new content) must grow DOWNWARD, and holding a button at the bottom of a
// growing body would hold the bottom and push the card's top up off the screen. It is re-taken on every
// scroll, pointer move and focus change, and after every correction, so it always describes the page as
// the human last saw it; a change is measured against it and undone.
//
// WHICH CARDS ARE ON SCREEN (where lib/stableQueue.ts lets a card that left the queue hold its place) is
// measured with a margin of a quarter of the viewport either side: a render can land between a scroll and
// the re-measure it schedules, and a card that had just scrolled into view must already count. And when
// that set changes, the host is asked to render again once the scrolling settles, so a ghost or a fading
// card the reader has scrolled away from goes while nobody is looking at it — never mid-scroll, where the
// correction would be an instant scroll cancelling the human's own.
//
// A RELOAD is the one move this cannot absorb as it happens — the dev server's full reload, a new build's,
// a restart's — and it used to land the reader at the top of a queue re-laid from nothing. A REMOUNT is
// the same move without the reload: an edit hot-swapping the page's module, the queue's error boundary
// recovering from a torn build. So the card being read and its offset are written down as the page goes
// or the queue unmounts, and when it comes back the page is held on that card, at that offset, while the
// queue loads around it: until the human scrolls, or a few seconds after the card first appears.
//
// It runs after every render of the queue (a layout effect: after the DOM changed, before paint) and
// whenever the document's size changes (a ResizeObserver: a card that fetched its transcript, an image
// that loaded — also before paint). A human's own scroll is never fought: it re-takes the anchor.
