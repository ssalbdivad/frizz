// WHERE AN ANSWERED REGISTERED QUESTION STAYS: in the slot its open card filled at the moment the human
// answered it. Until 2026-09-25 an answered card simply vanished — the row left `thread.questions`, and
// nothing drew the ask again — so a rest that had asked something read, afterwards, as a handoff that
// asked nothing (maintainer: "after a question is answered, it should continue showing up in a
// grayed-out way in the chat transcript, in the exact position where it was previously rendering").
//
// "Where it was rendering" is not stored anywhere, and it does not need to be: it is a pure function of
// the transcript AS IT STOOD when the answer was sent. The open card's position comes from two readers —
// a marker placement (lib/questionShadow placeQuestions) and the rest anchor (lib/questionAnchor
// questionsByAnchor) — and both read only the messages. So each answer batch replays exactly those two
// readers over the PREFIX of the transcript that existed before its `settledAt`. An open card stands at
// the rest that asked it however far the thread has moved on, so the settled one stays there too. What the
// worker wrote after the answer (the answer itself, the turn it woke) is outside the prefix, so it can
// neither move the card nor bury it.
//
// A question whose rest is older than the loaded window (anchor -1) draws nothing here. An OPEN one
// renders at the top of the window in that case, because it is still owed an answer and must not be out
// of reach; a settled one owes nothing, and it renders in its real slot once the earlier page is loaded.
