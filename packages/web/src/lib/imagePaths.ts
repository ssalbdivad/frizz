// Split a prose markdown run into ordinary markdown chunks, standalone local-IMAGE-path lines, and

// (or a just-attached) screenshot path as a block <img> and a document path as an openable file chip
// instead of dead mono text. Only a line that is SOLELY an absolute path (optionally wrapped in
// backticks) is promoted — an inline path inside a sentence stays prose, and a path INSIDE a fenced
// code block stays code (see the fence tracking below). Detection happens on the raw markdown BEFORE
// the sanitizer runs, so nothing loosens the HTML allowlist.
