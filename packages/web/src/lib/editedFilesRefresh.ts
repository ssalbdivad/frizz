// WHEN THE RAIL'S EDITED FILES ARE WORTH RE-READING. The list is computed by the server over the whole
// transcript and rides only the HTTP page read, never the /ws push (app-socket.ts makeTranscriptReader:
// the push fires on every byte-advance, and the reading costs a scan, a stat per file and a git spawn).
// So on a thread with a live push subscription — every open thread, normally — the rail kept the list
// its page load delivered: a file the worker wrote while the maintainer watched never appeared, and a
// file it deleted never left, until a window focus or a remount happened to re-read the page.
//
// The rail re-reads on two edges instead of on every push. A NEW WRITE: the newest tool call in the
// loaded window that could have created, changed or removed a file — a file tool, a Bash redirect or
// in-place edit (the same parser the server uses), or a Bash `rm`/`mv`/git-restore that can delete one.
// That test is deliberately generous: a false positive costs one page read, a false negative costs a
// stale row until the second edge. THE TURN ENDING: whatever the first edge missed (a script that
// deleted files, a write another process made) is settled once per turn.
