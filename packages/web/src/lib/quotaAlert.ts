// usage, upgrade, or let the work wind down on purpose.
//
// It speaks only when BOTH halves are true: a window is nearly out AND something on that provider is
// running. A low reading with nothing in flight interrupts nobody — the chip's red number already says
// it — and a card for it would be noise in a queue that is meant to hold only what wants the human.
