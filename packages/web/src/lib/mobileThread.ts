// THE PHONE THREAD HEADER'S SUBTITLE, as data: what the thread is doing, then how long it has been
// doing it, then what it runs on — `Needs you · 13h · Opus 5 · high`. The state word comes FIRST
// because it is the question a phone reader opens a thread to answer, and the accent on it means what
// the accent means everywhere else in the app: this is waiting on you, and nothing else earns it.
//
// "Needs you" is the board's own [?] — `sessionIndicatorKind(t) === "needs-input"` — and deliberately
// NOT the server's `needsYou` flag. That flag is queue MEMBERSHIP, and every ordinary rest joins the
// queue now, so keying on it would have spelled every rested thread "Needs you" and emptied the word
// of meaning. The header says what the board's mark says, one screen later.

  // and a done the human parked on "Watch #N" (server doneParkedOnWatch → waitStatus `watching` over the
  // event-snooze). Until 2026-10-07 this read only the wall-clock park — the split the board's AlarmMark
  // draws, which is a GLYPH choice — so a thread the human had just watched from its done card sat in
  // the Snoozed band on desktop while the phone header still called it "Rested".
