// THE QUEUE NEVER MOVES A CARD THE HUMAN IS LOOKING AT (maintainer 2026-09-28: "it needs to be guaranteed
// that cards that I'm currently viewing on the screen don't move in their position"). This is the ORDER
// half of that guarantee; lib/viewportLock.ts is the SCROLL half, and neither is enough alone.
//
// ONCE A CARD IS DRAWN, IT KEEPS ITS PLACE, AND EVERYTHING THAT ENTERS THE QUEUE JOINS THE BOTTOM
// (maintainer, the same day: "they should always be added to the bottom"). The queue's own order
// (groups.ts orderQueue: when each thread entered the queue, oldest or newest first) decides a FRESH
// draw — the page loading, a filter or the order setting changing — and nothing after it. An arrival is
// appended below every card on the page whatever its stamp says, in either order: newest-first puts the
// newest on top when the page is drawn, never by sliding a card in above the one being read.
//
// This used to be subtler, and every subtlety was a way to move something. Arrivals waited below the cards
// on screen and then crossed above them once off screen, the viewport lock absorbing the move — which
// still slid a stranger's tail into view where the top of the page had been, and still moved the page
// under the reader by exactly the card's height whenever the lock's accounting was a pixel off. An
// arrival's stamp can also sort it anywhere for reasons nobody acted on: another project's poll landing
// a few seconds late, a server restart re-listing its queue, a thread that woke itself on a finished
// shell coming back to its old place in line. None of those may reach the screen, so none of them
// reorders anything: appending moves nothing on screen, ever, and nothing else changes the order.
//
// A card whose thread leaves the queue while its card is on screen, without the human putting it away
// (it woke itself on a finished shell, a child's return, a timer; or someone acted on it from another
// tab), becomes a GHOST: an empty gap the card's height, holding its place until it scrolls off screen or the
// human next scrolls or presses a key (AllQueues.tsx) — or until the thread rests again, when it is simply
// the card again, in the same place. A card the human put away
// (done, snooze, a reply sent from its own box) is not a ghost; it leaves the ordinary way, and anything
// that follows it moving is the human's own doing. A card that leaves while OFF screen simply goes (the
// viewport lock holds the page if it was above), and should its thread come back, it is an arrival.
