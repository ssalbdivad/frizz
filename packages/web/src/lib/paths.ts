// PATHS THE BROWSER NEVER STATS, IN BOTH SPELLINGS. Every path the web client shows or resolves comes
// off the wire as text: a tool's `file_path`, a worker's cwd, the board's `projectDir` and `homeDir`,
// a link in rendered Markdown. Claude Code and Codex on Windows report all of those as
// `C:\Users\…` with backslashes, and the server passes `project.dir` and `homedir()` through unchanged
// (board.ts) — so a client that split on `/` alone showed the whole `C:\…` path as a title, drew the
// edited-files tree as one flat node per file, and could not resolve a single relative link inside a
// rendered local Markdown file (Windows audit 2026-09-11, finding 12: one root cause, six surfaces).
//
// This module is that root cause fixed once. It is LEXICAL — no `node:path`, no platform switch: the
// browser does not know which OS the server runs on, and a page can show a Linux server's paths from
// a Windows laptop. A path answers for itself: `pathSeparatorOf` reads the separator it already uses,
// `joinLike` keeps that separator and the drive when it builds a sibling, and `relativeTo` compares a
// drive letter case-insensitively because Windows does (`c:\proj` and `C:\proj` are one directory) while
// leaving every other segment's case alone. POSIX behaviour is byte-identical to the per-site helpers
// this replaced (pinned by each site's own tests, unchanged); the Windows cases sit beside them in
// paths.test.ts.
