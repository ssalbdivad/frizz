// PRODUCER 2 of the shared question model. A ```question fence is parsed into a `ParsedQuestion` by
// questionBlocks.ts; an `agent-question` INTERACTION — a native Claude AskUserQuestion tool call, or
// Codex's item/tool/requestUserInput — is converted into the same `ParsedQuestion` here, so both reach
// QuestionBlockCard as the same thing and cannot drift into two looks.
//
// The two shapes line up one-for-one, which is why one component can serve both:
//     AskUserQuestion   { question, header, options:[{label, description}], multiSelect }  + free text
//     ```question fence   a question line, numbered options with one-line trade-offs, an optional
//                         `multi` tag, and a free-text box at the bottom
// `multiSelect` IS `multi`; `options[].label — description` IS an option line.
//
// It also carries the mapping BACK: an interaction answer is submitted as typed field values, so each
// question keeps the field ids and the exact option values its choices must be submitted as. The
// display label and the submitted value are deliberately separate — the label may be clipped or
// scrubbed for the card, while the value must be the provider's exact bytes or the agent reads the
// answer as freeform prose instead of a pick.
