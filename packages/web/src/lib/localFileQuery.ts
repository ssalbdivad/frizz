// The ONE read of a local file the /full split viewer renders, shared by the panel that shows it and
// by the rail row that PREWARMS it on hover (maintainer 2026-09-01: "consider rendering optimizations
// like eager rendering when the user hovers over a given changed file"). Both must use the identical
// key and fetcher or the prefetch warms a cache entry the panel never looks in.
//
// Markdown reads through the reader gate (`.md` only, canonical path included); anything else reads
// through the text gate, which since 2026-09-03 is rooted identically — home-and-below plus the temp
// trees — so a worker's worktree file opens as readily as one in the project dir. Either way the result
// carries the CANONICAL path (symlinks resolved), which is what the panel labels, links relative to,
// and stamps on context items.
// The key alone — what the socket's `file-changed` frame invalidates (api/socket.ts), keyed by the
// path the reader subscribed with, which is the path it queried with.
//
// `project` names whose gate reads the file when that is not the page's own: a card on the everything
// page opens a file of ITS project (AllQueuesCard ProjectLinkScope), and a checkout outside home is
// readable only through that project's roots. It is the key's LAST element, so the socket's
// two-element key still invalidates it (TanStack matches a key by prefix).
