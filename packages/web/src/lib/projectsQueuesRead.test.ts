// The cache entry must say when the read it holds STARTED, on every read, through a real QueryClient — the
// layer that broke it. react-query's structural sharing never stores the array a read returned (a fresh
// copy when anything changed, the previous array when nothing did), so the read's own stamp was lost from
// the second changed read on, and the page's two readers (AllQueues.tsx useDepartedQueue and
// useLeavingCards) waited forever for a read they could never see: a project's queue the page left stayed
// frozen until a reload (found 2026-10-06 by scripts/verify-all-queues.mjs).
