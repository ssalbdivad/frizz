// WHEN THE PROJECT LIST HOLDS ITS LAYOUT — lib/heldLayout.ts is WHAT holding means; this is when.
//
// HELD WHILE THE POINTER IS OVER THE LIST, and for a moment after a press in it ends. Over the list is the
// only time a row can be aimed at, and the hazard is a move landing between the human's last look at a row
// and their click on it (the incident in heldLayout.ts). The press's grace covers a click whose pointer
// leaves the instant it lets go: the click lands on the row the human saw, and the drawer it opens renders
// before the moves the hold kept back.
//
// RELEASED WHEN THE POINTER LEAVES — not after it has been still for a while. A still pointer over a row is
// what reading a title before clicking it looks like, and any idle threshold is a moment a row can still
// swap just before the click. What a parked pointer costs is a list a beat stale in its ORDER only — every
// row's spinner, status and rest time stay live, and the queue beside it is not held at all — so the trade
// favours holding. Also released when the window loses focus or is hidden: a pointer cannot be aiming at a
// page the human has left, and the list they come back to is already current.
//
// AND RELEASED AT ONCE BY THE HUMAN RESHAPING THE LIST: folding a project, opening or closing a quiet band,
// showing more Done, dragging a project — any control marked `data-xq-reshape`. Those move the list under
// the pointer by the human's own hand, and what they bring in (a band's rows loading, the drop's new order)
// lands within SETTLE_MS, so the list follows the live layout until then rather than holding the very
// change the human asked for. Single rows the human moves (pin, reopen, Retry, a reply) do not need this:
// heldLayout moves just that row, through lib/humanActs.ts.
