// ONE PROJECT'S WHOLE BOARD, read from a page that names another — Everything's project list, for the bands
// its 3-second poll does not carry.
//
// `projectsQueues` carries every project's OPEN threads, which is all the queue and the list's current work
// need, and a COUNT of its Done ones: that band grows without bound, and a poll of every project every few
// seconds is the wrong place to ship it. So Done's rows — and External, the project's own terminals, which
// the poll drops — come from the project's own board snapshot, the same payload its live feed seeds from.
// Measured on the maintainer's machine (2026-09-28): 93KB for a project with 45 done threads, 5-7KB for the
// rest, each answered from the server's cached snapshot in under 5ms.
//
// READ AHEAD so opening a project is instant: the list prefetches every open project's board once the page
// is idle, and again under the pointer, so the rows are already in the cache when the click lands. While a
// project is open its query is live, and the poll's Done count moving invalidates it (ProjectList.tsx).
// Keyed `ofProject`, which the cache's project scoping leaves alone (lib/queryKeyScope.ts): the key already
// says whose board it is.
