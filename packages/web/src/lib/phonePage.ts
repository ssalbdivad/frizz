// THE PHONE PAGE'S MODEL — what each of its three tabs lists, across the projects the view shows
// (components/PhonePage.tsx). Pure, so the banding is tested without a browser and the component stays a
// layout.
//
// It is upstream's phone board (colinhacks/frizz MobileBoard.tsx, 2026-09-30) brought onto the fork's ONE
// page: that board listed one project's `sectionThreads`; this lists whichever projects the page's view
// shows — one when focused, every one in All projects — from the same machine-wide reads the desktop's
// list and queue draw (lib/allQueues.ts), banded by the list's own `loudBands` so a phone and a desktop
// can never disagree about which band a thread is in.
//
// THE QUEUE IS READY AND WORKING TOGETHER, asks first — upstream's call (maintainer review 2026-08-17:
// "something is active until it's marked done"), and on the one screen a phone has, "what needs me" earns
// the top. Within that, upstream's own order: PINNED leads (the phone has no pinned band, so the human's
// shelf folds into the top of the one list rather than vanishing), then the asks, then the rest of Ready
// in the queue's order, then Working by recency — `orderActive`'s order with the asks lifted out.
//
// AN ASK IS A ROW MARKED "?" (`isAsk`), the one mark that spends the accent. Upstream lifted and counted
// `needsAction` rows, which misses a permission request waiting on the human (`actionableInteraction`):
// its row wore the "?" while it sorted among the handoffs and the header's "need you" left it out
// (seen 2026-09-30 on the standup demo's lockfile-bump). The mark is what the eye counts, so the order
// and the header count the mark.
// Across projects the Ready rows merge in ONE queue order (the desktop's `mergedQueue`): one server stamps
// every project's `queuedAt` on one clock, so the stamps compare.
