// ── per-thread send serialization ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// The composer no longer locks while a send is in flight (a steer must feel instant, and half a
// second of dead textarea is the single biggest reason it did not — see Composer's `busy`). That
// removes the accidental serialization the lock used to provide, and TWO things depended on it:
//
//   · ORDER. Two follow-ups fired 200ms apart are two independent HTTP requests; nothing but arrival
//     order decides which reaches the worker's stdin first. The operator typed them in an order and
//     means it.
//   · The server's runtime-control CAS. `resumeThread` claims the row (beginRuntimeControl) for the
//     duration of the injection; a second follow-up arriving inside that window loses the CAS
//     and comes back "another runtime control is in progress" — a hard failure for a message the
//     human already watched appear in the transcript.
//
// So the QUEUE moves from the UI to the network: every surface bound to a slug shares one FIFO chain,
// keyed at module scope because the same thread is steerable from several mounted composers at once
// (queue card + drawer + a second tab's board). Each link runs regardless of its predecessor's
// outcome — a failed send rolls back only its own bubble and must not strand the sends behind it.

// ── delivery retry ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// A follow-up used to get exactly ONE attempt: any rejection handed the operator's message straight
// back to the composer under "Steer failed". But what actually fires here is CONTENTION, not refusal —
// resumeThread owns the row for the 300-830ms its synchronous injection takes, and a second writer
// arriving inside that window (the wakers scheduler, another tab, the submit-confirmer) loses the
// runtime-control CAS. The per-slug FIFO above only orders THIS tab's sends; it cannot see those. A
// build promotion is the same story from the other end: the mutation is refused before it is ever put
// on the wire while the control plane restarts.
//
// So a refusal that provably took NO EFFECT is now waited out instead of surfaced. Only errors the
// transport marked replayable are retried (isRetryableRpcError); an ambiguous failure — where the text
// may already have reached the worker — is never re-sent. The server independently dedups a replayed
// deliveryId against its delivery ledger, so even a misclassification here cannot paste a second copy.
//
// The retry deliberately runs INSIDE the FIFO link: a later send must not overtake the one being
// retried, because the operator typed them in an order and means it.

// A follow-up is a bare `fetch` with no deadline of its own, and it runs INSIDE the per-slug FIFO
// above whose links are `tail.then(run, run)`. So a request the server never answers does not merely
// lose its own message: it wedges the chain, and every steer typed into that thread afterwards waits
// behind it forever — optimistic bubble painted, no toast, no rollback, nothing on the wire. Only a
// reload clears it, and nothing on screen suggests one.
//
// Measured 2026-09-05 on `design-nub-static-server`: one `turn/start` blocked server-side for 1h 18m
// (see codex-app-server.ts `ensureCurrentAuth`), and from the operator's side every later steer was
// swallowed in silence — "my steers that I was typing into the box were not reopening the thread".
//
// The deadline is deliberately far longer than any healthy send: a cold session resume plus a turn
// start is seconds, and codex sends were measured at p50 3.3s with tails into the minutes. This is not
// a latency budget, it is the difference between one lost message and a permanently dead composer. An
// abort is AMBIGUOUS — the text may already have reached the worker — so it is never marked
// retryable; it rolls back one bubble, and the server's deliveryId ledger dedups a manual re-send.

// delivery lands, not when the operator hit Enter, which under contention can be seconds and several
