// OPTIMISTIC ARCHIVE STATE — "this thread is done", rendered on the rail the instant the operator
// clicks rather than when the server can prove it. The exact twin of lib/steering.ts, for the other
// direction, and it exists for the same reason: a lifecycle verb whose two surfaces disagreed.
//
// The QUEUE card has dismissed optimistically since the optimistic-done work — click Mark as done and
// the card fades immediately, ahead of the completeThread round-trip. The project board's SIDEBAR had no
// such path: its bands are derived purely from board.threads, so the row sat in Rested until the
// server's board delta arrived. Every millisecond the server took to answer was a millisecond where the
// card was gone and the row was still there (maintainer 2026-08-11: "often extreme delay in updating
// sidebar after clicking Mark as done"). Server latency is worth fixing on its own terms — and is,
// separately — but a rail that waits on a round-trip to show a decision the operator already made is
// the wrong shape at ANY latency. That sidebar read the overlay across its bands until 2026-09-28, when
// it went with the project board; today its reader is the drawer header's band stamp (BandLabel.tsx).
//
// Not a second source of truth: the hint only fires while server truth has said nothing, and yields the
// moment it does.
const archiving = proxy({ at: {} as Record<string, number> })

// How long the hint may outlive its evidence. A completion that has not shown up on the board in this
// long is one the operator should see the truth about rather than a guess — and the explicit rollback
// paths below (a declined completion, a failed RPC) normally clear it long before this fires.
