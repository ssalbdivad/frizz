// The composer's `/` typeahead, on the same footing as its `@` one (lib/threadMentions.ts): a `/` at a
// word boundary with the caret inside its token opens the menu, choosing a row completes that token in
// place, and a finished `/name` the thread can actually run is TINTED in the prompt box — in its own
// colour, so a skill never reads as a thread (David 2026-10-02: "autocomplete that works with the
// same mechanism as tagging other threads but uses a different highlight color").
//
// One asymmetry is the harness's, not ours. Claude runs a built-in COMMAND (`/context`, `/usage`) only
// when it OPENS the message; anywhere else it is plain text the model reads. A SKILL is invocable by
// name anywhere. So a command is offered, and tinted, only as the draft's first token, and a skill at
// any boundary — the tint never promises something the send will not do. A USER command
// (`~/.agents/commands/armstrong.md`) is Frizz's to expand, and it expands anywhere, so it rides as a skill.
