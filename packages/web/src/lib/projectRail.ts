/**
 * The last answer the server gave, so the FIRST paint can be the right one.
 *
 * `projectRail` lives in server settings, which arrive an RPC round trip after React's first render.
 * Without a local copy the rail was absent for that render and then appeared, pushing every page
 * 57px to the right in front of the operator on every refresh (maintainer 2026-08-25: "This is
 * layout shift"). Same problem, same cure as the font: `index.html` reads `frizz-font` from
 * localStorage before first paint, and `font.ts` writes it back whenever settings load. Wrong only on
 * the first load in a fresh browser profile — and wrong in the direction the server default is.

/**
 * Whether the permanent project rail is showing.
 *
 * ONE definition, because two surfaces depend on it and they must never both be absent: the rail
 * itself, and the status bar's home crumb, which exists precisely to be the way back when the rail
 * is not there. While the query is still in flight it answers with the localStorage mirror above,
 * which is the server's last answer in this browser; before the mirror existed it defaulted to
 * HIDDEN, and every refresh with the rail on shifted the whole page once the answer arrived.
 *
 * THE CACHE ENTRY IS PER PROJECT, AND THIS HOOK OUTLIVES A PROJECT. `["settingsGet"]` hashes under
 * the project the URL names at RENDER time (lib/queryKeyScope.ts), and the layout that calls this
 * hook is mounted once and never re-rendered by a navigation — so without the `useLocation()` below
 * it stayed bound to whichever project's entry it was cold-loaded on. The settings drawer writes its
 * save under the CURRENT project's entry (it only mounted inside a project's board then). Cold-load `/`,
 * click into a project, flip "Project sidebar" to "Always shown": the select flipped and the rail
 * did not, until a reload happened to land on a board (maintainer 2026-08-24: "it literally only
 * shows up when I'm in the home page"). Reading the location re-renders this on every navigation,
 * so the key re-hashes under the project now on screen — the same entry the drawer writes.
 *
 * `keepPreviousData` is what keeps that re-hash from blinking: the new project's entry starts empty
 * and the rail would drop out for the round trip. `projectRail` is a MACHINE setting (server
 * settings.ts), so the previous project's answer is the right placeholder, not merely a tolerable one.
