// PRODUCER 3 of the shared question model. A ```question fence is parsed into a `ParsedQuestion` by
// questionBlocks.ts; an `agent-question` INTERACTION is converted into one by interactionQuestion.ts;
// and a REGISTERED question — a row a worker created with the `ask` tool — is converted here. All
// three reach QuestionBlockCard as the same thing, which is the whole reason there is one card.
//
// What a registration adds over the other two producers is a STATIC TREE: an option may carry
// `followUps`, questions that become live only once the human picks that option. So a registration is
// not one card but a walk — the root is always live, and a follow-up is live exactly while its parent
// option is chosen. `liveQuestionNodes` performs that walk against the answers staged so far, and
// `registeredAnswer` folds the same walk back into the `QuestionAnswer` payload the worker receives.
//
// A BRANCH NOT TAKEN CONTRIBUTES NOTHING. Deselecting an option does not blank its follow-ups' staged
// answers (the human may come back), but they stop being live, so they never reach the payload: an
// absent follow-up means "not asked", never "asked and skipped".
