// WHICH OF FRIZZ'S OWN VIEWERS A LOCAL FILE OPENS IN — or none, when only the desktop opener can show
// it. A click on a path used to launch an app for everything but Markdown: a screenshot a worker just
// took opened in whatever the OS maps `.png` to, which on a WSL box is a browser tab (maintainer
// 2026-09-28: "clicking on it should expand it in-app, not try to open externally in a browser. same
// with other file types we can trivially view"). The rule is now the reverse — anything the page can
// draw by itself is drawn here, and the escape hatch to the desktop opener rides in every viewer's
// header or footer as "Open":
//
//   · "image"    — the picture viewer (components/ImageViewer): the raster set `/local-image` serves,
//                  plus SVG, which the viewer renders from the file's TEXT as a `data:` image — where
//                  no script in it can run — because the image proxy deliberately never serves one.
//   · "markdown" — the reader, rendered.
//   · "text"     — the reader, as highlighted source.
//
// "text" is the DEFAULT, not an allowlist, on purpose. The reader already refuses binary with a plain
// "not a text file" (a NUL in the first 8 KiB, server-side), and a list of text extensions is exactly
// what sent a Makefile, a `.env.example` or a `.vue` file out to an editor while `.ts` stayed in: the
// /full page's split viewer has always taken every non-image file for that reason. What is listed is
// the other side — formats whose bytes are not text and which a desktop app renders properly: the
// office, data and archive tiers of the attachment allowlist, PDF, media, fonts and compiled objects.
// PDF sits there although a browser can draw one, because the desktop shell enables no PDF plugin.
// Missing an entry costs one click on the reader's "Open", never a wrong answer.
