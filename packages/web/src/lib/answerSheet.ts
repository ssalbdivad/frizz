// THE PHONE ANSWER SHEET'S STEP MODEL (components/RegisteredAnswerSheet.tsx), kept pure so the walk is
// testable without a browser.
//
// One STEP per live question node, across every open registration on the thread, in the order the
// desktop cards draw them: each root, then the follow-ups its taken option opens (lib/registeredQuestion
// liveQuestionNodes — the same walk, so a follow-up is a step exactly while the desktop would draw its
// card). A review step always follows the last one; it is not in this list.
//
// The list is DERIVED FROM THE STAGED ANSWERS, so it changes under the sheet: picking an option that
// carries follow-ups inserts steps right after it, and picking a different option removes them. The
// sheet therefore addresses a step by its KEY (`<question id>|<node path>`), never by its index, and
// computes "the step after this pick" against the answers the pick is about to produce
// (`stepAfterPick`) — the new list is not on screen yet in the tap that asks for it.
