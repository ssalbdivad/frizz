// OPTIMISTIC PIN — the pin and unpin land on the list the instant the operator clicks, the same way a
// reply (lib/steering.ts) and Mark as done (lib/optimisticArchive.ts) already do.
//
// Until 2026-10-01 the row's button only dimmed and waited: setThreadPinned reads the board and
// re-assembles it before it answers, and the row moved when the board push or the poll behind it landed.
// Measured against a quiet live server that was ~200ms from click to the row changing (curl to the same
// RPC: 50–90ms); on a loaded one, where a single poll has taken 25s, it was as long as the server was
// busy — and a disabled button at 50% opacity for that long reads as a click that did not register
// (maintainer: "clicking unpin feels very slow/unresponsive").
//
// Not a second source of truth. Keyed by `threadKey(projectId, slug)`, since the list draws every
// project and two projects can share a slug; dropped when the RPC fails, and capped so a prediction the
// board never confirms cannot outlive its evidence.
