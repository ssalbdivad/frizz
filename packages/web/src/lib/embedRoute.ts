// the row VS Code already draws above the frame is the header, so the page tells it the view's name and
// the reading beside it, and the row's buttons come back as `frizz:command` (lib/embedCommand.ts).
//
// The page's own surfaces decide the reading (AllQueues.tsx SidebarPage, StandaloneThreadPage.tsx); this
// module is what they share — the pure choice of what the row says, and a poster that says it only when
// it changed, since the page re-renders on every poll.
