/** THE WORKER'S OWN PROSE for a hover popover — the fence's Markdown BODY, else its legacy `reason:`.

 *  OPTIONAL prose, since what frizz actually requires is a live item and a `for:`. `reason:` is the
 *  one-line form that shape replaced, and it was retired outright at the YAML cutover; it survives here
 *  only to read a fence stored before then. Reading only `reason:` therefore drops the handoff of every
 *  fence written the CURRENT way, which is what the rail popover did until this existed.
 *
 *  The FIRST PARAGRAPH only, and its internal line breaks flattened: a body may run to 500 characters of
 *  headings and bullets, and a hover label is not where you read that. It is the lede a worker already
 *  writes — the card below the rail renders the whole thing.

/** THE WORKER'S OWN PROSE, PRESENTED AS A SENTENCE — capitalized, because everywhere frizz draws it, it

 *
 *  Workers write it lowercase, and that is frizz's own doing — the shipped contract's example read
 *  `reason: what you are waiting for, in one line`, so a fence arrived as a fragment and rendered as one
 *  ("At rest — waiting on acme/app#391" over "the tap submission is queued…", maintainer 2026-08-19:
 *  "why is that second sentence fucking lowercase?"). The example now models a sentence, but a worker's
 *  contract is FROZEN INTO ITS SYSTEM PROMPT AT DISPATCH: every session already running keeps writing
 *  the old shape, so the presentation has to carry it and always will. (`reason:` as a KEY is retired —
 *  2026-08-24 — but the handoff it carried simply moved below the `---`, and it arrives just as lowercase
 *  from a frozen contract, so this is unchanged by the cutover.)
 *

 *  (`awaitingFragments`), a path (`packages/web`), a ref (`v2.1`, `#391`) or a lowercase-by-name tool

// It is not prose, it is a malformed declaration — the worker gets BUMPED for it (scheduler SOURCE 12),
// which is where that belongs, and the card says what it can rather than showing the machinery.
//
// NULL, not a placeholder sentence: the card's heading and rows already state the wait, so an empty
// handoff wants no filler and no divider above one. The one card that has neither — a fence in a
// sub-agent's own transcript, with no thread and so no rows — says AWAITING_NO_PROSE instead, and that

/** WHAT THIS THREAD IS WAITING ON, as a CLAUSE — the middle of a sentence the row's popover finishes.
 *
 *  The rail's rows carry a TITLE and nothing else (maintainer 2026-08-19: "there should never ever be
 *  any fucking thing in the sidebar except for the fucking title"), so every fence detail that used to
 *  ride a subtitle moved into the row's popover — and it has to READ there, not merely be present. The
 *  first cut printed one fragment per hint kind, stacked ("Watching acme/app#391 — new activity wakes
 *  it" over "Waiting on a background shell" over the reason), which is a machine dumping its record
 *  rather than a sentence telling you anything (maintainer, same day: "that popover text looks fucking
 *  terrible").
 *
 *  So: ONE verb over ONE list. "waiting on" is what a person actually says about all of it — a PR, a
 *  shell, a child, a clock — and a single conjoined list is what makes four facts read as one thought.
 *  The PR keeps its REF because that names a thing you might go look at; everything else is COUNTED,
 *  because a runtime id ("bzvtnt3ig") means nothing on a hover and three of them is a wall.
 *
 *  Order is fixed by KIND, not by the order the worker wrote the fence in, so two fences naming the
 *  same things read identically. Null when the fence names nothing — a park the server refuses anyway,
 *  so the popover says what it knows and invents no wait. */
