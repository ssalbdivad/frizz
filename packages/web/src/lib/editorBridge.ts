// THE PAGE'S HALF OF THE EDITOR BRIDGE (packages/vscode; ARCHITECTURE.md § VS Code extension). Three jobs, all
// machine-wide, so this module is set up once per page (main.tsx) rather than per project:
//
//  1. WHICH EDITOR WINDOWS ARE CONNECTED — store.editorWindows, read at boot and replaced by every
//     `editors` event. The settings drawer marks the External app that has a window behind it.
//  2. THE FIRST-CONNECTION OFFER — the first time this browser sees an accepting VS Code or Cursor window
//     while its code files go elsewhere, a toast offers to send them there. Once per editor per browser.
//  3. PROMPT-BOX INSERTS — "Add to Frizz prompt" in an editor leaves an item on the server and pings every
//     page (`compose-pending`). The page the human is LOOKING AT claims it (`composeTake`, first caller
//     wins) and puts it in the box in front of them — on the ping when it has focus, else on the focus
//     that follows (the human switching from their editor to this tab), and once at boot. There is no
//     leader election and no tab id: focus is the election, and the server's claim is the lock.
//
// IN AN EDITOR'S SIDEBAR (lib/embed.ts) jobs 2 and 3 stand down. The offer asks where code files should
// go, and inside the editor's own sidebar they go to that editor already (lib/local-file-links.ts). And
// the page never claims a held item: the extension that frames it posts its selections straight in
// (`frizz:compose`, lib/embedHost.ts → composeInto below), so a held item is one from a window WITHOUT a
// sidebar — meant for a browser tab — and a sidebar that claimed it on the human's next click into it
// would take it from that tab.
