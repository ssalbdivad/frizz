// that requirement belonged to a mechanism that no longer exists: the verb used to TYPE `/rename` into
// the session's terminal and scrape the answer back, so a turn in flight (or an open permission
// prompt) owned the composer it needed. The RPC has gone through the broker's typed control channel
// since 2026-08-24 — the same request shape as reload-plugins, stop-task and interrupt, none of which
// waits for a turn to finish — so the old gate did nothing but make the button a silent no-op on
// exactly the threads you are watching (maintainer 2026-08-26: "when you click it, it currently does
// not do anything at all"). What it genuinely needs is a LIVE broker daemon to ask.
