// The counts on the line above a queue card's docked prompt box (QueueOpsSummary), in display order,
// with the empty kinds dropped. Taken from the same lists the rows in its panel render, by the same
// filters, so the line and the panel cannot disagree about how many there are.
//
// THE FORK'S ROWS, NOT UPSTREAM'S. Upstream counted `agents` and `shells` (the board's bgShells) because
// its panel drew QueueSubAgentLines and BackgroundOpsStrip. The cross-project card's panel draws the rows
// its ops column drew under the reply box until 2026-10-06: AGENT and WORKFLOW rows (QueueChildOps), then
// every live process on the thread — the agent's shells and the human's own terminals, one TERM row each
// (ThreadTerminals cardProcesses). So the counts are agents, workflows and terminals, then the PR/issue
// watches and saved files and links upstream's panel added.
//
// `agents: false` while the card's awaiting card lists the children itself (drawsSubAgentWaitCard): the
// panel draws no AGENT rows then, so the line counts none.
//
// ONLY GITHUB WATCHES COUNT. A shell watch is not a second object: the shell it waits on is already a
// terminal, from the board's own shell list, and counting the watch too would name one process twice — the
// double-naming the lifecycle footer's watcher readout was removed for (2026-08-14).
