// MENTION TOKEN — `@guide.md:3`, the chip's own label behind an `@` — spliced into the draft prose at

// token. The token IS the chip: a <textarea> cannot host a pill, so the reference is text the human
// can read as-is, and the composer paints the pill behind it (Composer's backdrop). The first cut
// used footnote markers, `[^1]`, and the maintainer read them as plumbing (2026-09-03: "rendering as
// [^1] looks a little weird … worse than just rendering the chip inline. the footnote structure is an
// INTERNAL detail") — so nothing numbered reaches the human anywhere now, and the wire carries the
// same self-describing token the composer shows. Tokens-in-the-text is the load-bearing part
// (2026-09-02): the human interleaves chip, comment, chip, comment, and the agent can only know
// which comment refers to which selection if the reference sits at its original position. Text, not
// a side-channel: the worker reads the same transcript the human does, and `@file:line` beside a
// quoted block is the shape every coding agent already uses (see the prior-art report in the
// dispatching thread's scratch directory — Zed, Copilot and Claude Code all key an inline mention
// to a grouped tail this way).
