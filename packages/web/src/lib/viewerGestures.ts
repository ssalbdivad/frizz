// THE PICTURE VIEWERS' GESTURES — the zoom, the pan and the swipe, stated once for both of Frizz's
// full-screen viewers: the lightbox a ```lightbox gallery opens (components/Lightbox.tsx, upstream's
// 0e81902b) and the picture viewer a click on any single picture opens (components/ImageViewer.tsx, the
// fork's). Each was written for one of them; the picture viewer had fit / actual size and ←/→ only, so a
// screenshot opened from a transcript could not be pinched on a phone, wheel-zoomed, dragged or swiped,
// while the same screenshot in a gallery could (parity ledger, 0e81902b: PARTIAL). One hook, so the two
// cannot drift into two zooms that answer the same finger differently.
//
// What it does, upstream's behaviour unchanged (0e81902b): a mouse click toggles fit and the picture's own
// pixels about the cursor (lib/viewerZoom.ts detailScale); ctrl/⌘ + wheel — a trackpad pinch — and
// Safari's gesture events zoom about the pointer; a plain wheel or a drag moves a magnified picture; the
// caller's + − 0 keys and buttons step it (`zoomBy`, `fit`, `zoomKey`). On a touch screen a pinch zooms and
// pans at once, a double tap toggles, one finger pans a magnified picture, and at fit a sideways swipe
// pages and a vertical one closes. The stage must be `touch-action: none` (the caller's style), so the
// browser claims none of those gestures for the page. Every move is one of the pure moves in
// lib/viewerZoom.ts, applied as ONE transform over the picture's fitted layout box (`pictureTransform`).
