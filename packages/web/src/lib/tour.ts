// FIRST RUN — the onboarding a browser sees once: a project to start in (components/Onboarding.tsx
// ProjectPick, at a bare `/`), then a short tour of that project's board (Tour). A browser that arrives on a
// board directly — `frizz` run in a project opens `/project/<slug>` — has its project already, and gets
// only the tour.
//
// "Once" is per BROWSER, like the last view (crossProject.ts): `frizz.onboarded` is written when the tour
// ends, however it ends. A browser that already has a view on record from before the onboarding existed
// gets it too: the pick lists every project it already has, and the tour shows what the board has become
// since — David, 2026-10-07, upgrading without ever having taken it: "I should get the tour and project
// intro". Captured at module load, so the decision holds for the whole page.
