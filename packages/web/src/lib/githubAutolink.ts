// almost never spell as a URL: an issue/PR number (`#123`, `owner/repo#123`) and a commit hash
// (`749a37b`, `owner/repo@749a37b`). GitHub does this inside issues and PRs; Frizz's chat is where
// the same shorthand is written, and it was rendering as inert text.
//
// WHY A TOKEN REWRITE AND NOT A REGEX OVER THE MARKDOWN. Running this over the raw source would
// rewrite `#123` inside a fenced block, an inline `code` span, a link destination and a URL — all
// places where the author's bytes must survive verbatim, and where a hex-looking run is most likely
// NOT a commit. Rewriting TOKENS instead means code is literal by construction (marked never
// re-tokenizes it), and the traversal below simply declines to descend into a link or an image, so a
// `[see #12](…)` label can never mint an anchor inside an anchor.
//
// It runs from marked's `processAllTokens` hook rather than `walkTokens` because the hook is handed
// the ROOT array. `walkTokens` only ever hands you a token, so a top-level text token — which is the
// whole document on the `parseInline` path (answer chips, the awaiting caption) — has no parent whose
// children could be spliced, and that surface would have been silently skipped.

// NOT lib/githubRef.ts, and the overlap is deliberate. That one turns a ref a WATCHER already told us
// is a pull request into `/pull/N`; this one has only prose to go on, where a bare `#123` is an issue
// more often than not — so it builds `/issues/N`, which GitHub redirects to the PR when the number
// turns out to be one. Same site, different question, opposite default.

// so a UUID's segments (`da3513c7-634b-…`) are never mistaken for short hashes; `@` so an
// `owner/repo@sha` that this pattern declines to match cannot have its bare tail linked to the WRONG
