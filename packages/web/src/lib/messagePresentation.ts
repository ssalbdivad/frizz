// THE MOST RECENT INTERACTION — the last turn the human themself put into the thread. The QUEUE CARD
// opens here: its handoff quotes this message (server router.ts `handoffOf`), and its transcript, opened
// in place, starts at it, so everything before it is history behind "Load earlier messages".
//
// Upstream's own function (lib/messagePresentation.ts at 0a3b9139), restored 2026-10-06 when the card's
// transcript came back — and held to the SERVER's rule rather than upstream's copy of it, because the card
// shows both halves at once: the handoff the server cut and the transcript this cuts. The server's
// `isHumanTurn` has since grown three cases upstream's web copy never had, and a disagreement would open
// the transcript on a different message than the handoff it replaces:
//   • a `kind` row (an event line, a reasoning summary) is punctuation, never a turn;
//   • a SPINOFF request, and a turn with nothing in it, are not the human speaking here;
//   • an "Ask for update" click IS the human's turn, though it rides in as a park wake: the progress note
//     under it is the reply to the click (router.ts isUpdateRequest).
//
// Anything frizz composed is out, not just anything frizz delivered. A `wake` user record is frizz writing
// as the user — the Goal delivery, the sign-off reminder, a watcher wake — and cutting there opened the card
// on frizz's own boilerplate with the human's task hidden above it (maintainer 2026-08-12: "queue cards
// STILL need to go all the way back to the last user message"). A `peerFrom` record is a SUB-AGENT
// reporting up, an `agentInstruction` a coordinator speaking into a CHILD, and a QUEUED send has not been
// delivered, so nothing after it is a reply to it.
//
// …EXCEPT THE ONE TURN FRIZZ DELIVERS THAT THE HUMAN WROTE: the answer to a REGISTERED question. It rides in
// as a scheduler wake because the human may have answered while the worker's process was down, so `wake`
// alone cannot decide the writer; the answers header (shared questionAnswerMessage) does (maintainer
// 2026-08-31: "the cue card should only go back to the most recent user interaction").
//
// 0 — the whole loaded transcript — when the human has written nothing in it yet.
