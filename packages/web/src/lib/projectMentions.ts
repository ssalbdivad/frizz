// `#slug` NAMES A PROJECT (David 2026-10-06: "add # syntax for referring to projects like #home and
// #arktype that autocompletes and is styled similarly to @thread-name"). The sibling of the `@handle`
// grammar (threadMentions.ts): the prompt box offers the projects on this machine as `#` is typed and
// tints a finished one, a human's bubble links it, and agent prose links it the same way
// (mentionAutolink.ts). What lands after `#` is the project's registry slug — the `<slug>` in
// `/project/<slug>`, already kebab-case and unique — so there is nothing to fold: a mention resolves when
// its text IS a slug, case aside.
//
// A bare `#123` stays GitHub's (githubAutolink.ts, plainLinks.ts): an all-digit token is never a project
// mention, even where a project's slug happens to be digits.
