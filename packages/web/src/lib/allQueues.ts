// Two reads meet here and neither is enough alone: `projectsList` is every REGISTERED project in the
// operator's own rail order (and carries the icon), `projectsQueues` is every project with a board OPEN
// on this server (and carries the threads). A registered project with no open board is still drawn —
// quiet, and saying why — rather than silently missing from a page that promises all of them.
//
// Banding is the rail's own, from groups.ts, so this page and a project's sidebar can never disagree
// about which band a thread is in: the queue is `queued` in the `orderQueue` order the project's cue uses
// (a pinned thread that needs you is in it, exactly as its queue card is on its own board), Running is the
// Active band minus the queue, Snoozed is the Snoozed band.
