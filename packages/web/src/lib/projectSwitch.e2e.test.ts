// WHICH PROJECT THE LIVE FEED IS POINTED AT, after a client-side switch — the one thing no unit test
// here can reach. The pieces are all individually fine and were when this broke: `apiBase()` derives
// the right base from the path, `wsUrl()` derives from `apiBase()`, `rebindProject()` drops and
// re-opens correctly, and `<App/>` is keyed by slug so it genuinely remounts. The bug lived in the
// seam — routes.tsx guarded the rebind with a `useRef` seeded from the slug it was looking at, so any
// switch that changed which ROUTE matched (the grid to a board, which is what the grid's tiles do)
// mounted a FRESH component whose ref already said "bound", skipped the rebind entirely, and left the
// socket on the previous project. Every board then rendered the launching project's threads under
// another project's URL, and nothing but a document load recovered it (reported 2026-08-11).
//
// So this asserts the socket URL, not the render: it is the one artifact that says which project the
// board data is actually coming from, and it is recorded from `evaluateOnNewDocument` so the module-load
// connection is captured too.
