// WHICH PROJECT THE LIVE FEED IS POINTED AT, after a client-side switch — the one thing no unit test
// here can reach. The pieces are all individually fine and were when this broke: `apiBase()` derives
// the right base from the page's project, `wsUrl()` derives from `apiBase()`, and `rebindProject()`
// drops and re-opens correctly. The bug lived in the seam — routes.tsx guarded the rebind with a
// `useRef` seeded from the slug it was looking at, so a switch that mounted a FRESH component (the
// project grid's tiles into a board, when this broke) found a ref that already said "bound", skipped the
// rebind entirely, and left the socket on the previous project. Every board then rendered the launching
// project's threads under another project's URL, and nothing but a document load recovered it
// (reported 2026-08-11). The rebind now asks the feed itself (routes.tsx useProjectBinding).
//
// The page has TWO client-side switches, and both rebind: the page title's switcher moves the page to a
// project's board, `/project/<slug>` (a navigation within the one mounted page — routes.tsx PageRoute), and
// in All projects the prompt box's project picker re-binds the page to its pick without any navigation.
// Until 2026-09-28 the switch was a project row's ⋯ → Open board, a client-side navigation to
// `/project/<slug>`; from then until focus mode (2026-09-29) the picker was the only one, and from then
// until 2026-10-06 the switcher's board was the query `/?project=<slug>`.
//
// So this asserts the socket URL, not the render: it is the one artifact that says which project the
// page's live data is actually coming from, and it is recorded from `evaluateOnNewDocument` so the
// module-load connection is captured too.
