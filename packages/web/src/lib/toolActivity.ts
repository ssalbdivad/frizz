/**
 * Calls that keep their dedicated card instead of entering the minimal activity disclosure.
 *
 * Three families qualify. The first two qualify for the SAME reason: the call LAUNCHES something that
 * outlives it, so the card is not a record of work already done — it is the only handle the reader has on
 * work still running (or on a process that ran detached and finished while they were reading something
 * else).
 *
 *   • A DISPATCH — it starts, addresses or blocks on a child agent.
 *   • A LIVE BACKGROUND op — `run_in_background` Bash and Monitor (`backgroundState: "background"`)
 *     while still `pending`, plus the blocked `&` job the Bash parser flags `"unknown"`. These used to
 *     fold into the run like any other call, which meant a detached dev server, a CI watcher and a
 *     wait-for-agents poller were all invisible behind `Ran 7 tool calls` — the one class of call whose
 *     whole point is that it is still going after the batch that started it (maintainer 2026-08-01:
 *     "eject background tasks from the tool call collapsing logic. It's important that those show up in
 *     the chat"). ONLY WHILE IT IS GOING, though: once the shell's terminal <task-notification> has
 *     landed the call is `completed`/`failed`/`cancelled`, the completion wake divider is the visible
 *     record, and the card — which by then draws no mark and reads `done · 20s` exactly like a
 *     foreground Bash — was standing alone between two digests for a reason nothing on it stated
 *     (maintainer 2026-09-12: "why this random uncollapsed bash call??"; 2026-09-13: "Fold it once
 *     finished"). So a finished background op folds back into the run — see finishedBackgroundOp. The
 *     `"unknown"` job never gets a completion signal, so it keeps its card whatever its status.
 *     An ORPHANED POLL wears the same `"unknown"` and is deliberately NOT here — see orphanedPoll.
 *   • A call whose RESULT IS A PICTURE — an image `Read`, a `take_screenshot`, a SendUserFile delivery
 *     carrying images. The reason is different but no weaker: the whole content of the card is something
 *     the human has to LOOK at, and a digest reduces it to the one thing a picture cannot survive being
 *     reduced to — a word. A worker reading back its own screenshots produced exactly `2 tool calls ·
 *     Click to expand` with both shots hidden behind it (maintainer 2026-08-02: "the screenshots should
 *     just be rendered in the chat automatically").
 *
 *   • A SETTLED native ask (`AskUserQuestion` carrying its structured questions, with a result). The
 *     question was ON SCREEN as an answerable card until it settled; folding it into `Ran N tool calls`
 *     is how an unanswered question vanished from the transcript the moment the operator steered past
 *     it (maintainer 2026-08-30: "the questions should continue to render as they were from earlier in
 *     the transcript, even if they weren't answered"). A PENDING ask stays foldable: while it is live,
 *     the interaction stack owns the answerable copy, and history must not draw it twice.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT here: codex's `list_agents` ("Agents · list live agents"), which is a plain READ of
 * the roster — it starts nothing, addresses nobody, and its whole body is a one-line count, so a model
 * that polls it mid-burst was splitting one batch into `Ran 1 tool call` / a standalone Agents card /
 * `Ran 4 tool calls` (maintainer 2026-07-31: "The agent listing should not be specially handled here.
 * It's a tool call like any other"). Nor a SendUserFile carrying only NON-image files: that renders as a
 * row of openable chips, which the digest's label already describes as well as the card would.

/**
 * Rewrite absolute in-project paths as project-relative ones for display.
 *
 * `detail` carries the provider's raw input, and every Claude/Codex file tool passes an ABSOLUTE path,
 * so the shimmer reads `Editing /Users/me/Documents/projects/frizz/packages/web/src/App.tsx` — one
 * short row whose only identifying part is pushed off the end by a home prefix that never varies.
 * Stripping the project root leaves `Editing packages/web/src/App.tsx`.
 *
 * The root is the board's `projectDir`, which is the git toplevel of the dir the server was launched in
 * — so when Frizz runs on a linked worktree that IS the worktree root, and no separate detection is
 * needed. A worktree a worker created underneath the project keeps its own directory in the relative
 * path (`wt-fix/ui/…`), which is exactly the disambiguation you want. Paths outside the project are left
 * absolute: there is no root that makes them both shorter and honest.
 *
 * Applied to the finished label rather than to `detail` alone so a Bash description's arguments shorten
 * too, and every occurrence is replaced because a command line can name several paths. The trailing
 * slash is part of the needle, so a sibling checkout (`…/frizz-old/a.ts`) never matches.
 *
 * A path outside the project still gets its home prefix collapsed to `~` — `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` says
 * the same thing in a quarter of the width. The browser can't read $HOME, but the board snapshot
 * carries the server's own `homeDir` (board.ts), and that is `homeDir` here. Without one (a caller
 * that never had a board, a pre-2026-08 server) the guess stands: the project root's own leading
 * `/Users/<user>`, `/home/<user>` or `C:\Users\<user>`; any other shape (a repo under `/opt`, `/srv`,
 * a volume) yields no home and those paths stay absolute rather than being cut at a guess.
 *
 * The root and the paths may be Windows paths — `C:\Users\x\proj` is what the board's `projectDir`
 * IS when the server runs there — and until the Windows audit (2026-09-11, finding 12) a root that
 * did not start with `/` bailed, so every label read the full absolute path. pathPrefixPattern
 * matches the root in either separator and either drive-letter case, and abbreviateHome keeps the
 * separator that followed the home (`~\.claude\CLAUDE.md`).
