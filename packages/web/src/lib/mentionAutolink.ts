// `@handle` AND `@thread.child` IN AGENT PROSE ARE LINKS (David 2026-09-30: "ensure that in cases
// where agents refer to each other, it doesn't refer to 'another agent' but refers to the fully
// qualified name so you can easily click to view that agent"). The worker is prompted to write the
// address; this is what makes it a click. A human's bubble already did it (MentionLinks.tsx); every
// surface that renders AGENT markdown — the transcript's assistant turns, a queue card's handoff, the
// done and awaiting cards — goes through lib/markdown.ts instead, so the same resolution runs here as a
// token pass beside the GitHub autolinker, with the same reasons for being one (githubAutolink.ts):
// code spans and blocks are literal by construction, and an existing link is never descended into.
//
// A mention links only when its THREAD resolves against the page's board, by the same fold a human's
// mention uses (threadMentions.ts resolveMention) — so `@types/node`, a decorator, an email address
// and a handle nobody has stay exactly what they were. A plain `@thread` becomes an in-app
// `/thread/<slug>` link, which the one delegated listener already opens in the drawer
// (lib/thread-links.ts); a dotted one carries its address in the fragment, `/thread/<slug>#<address>`,
// and the same listener resolves it against the thread's sub-agent directory. A modified click follows
// the href to the thread itself, as it does for a human's mention.

// The page's handles, and the project they belong to. Module state for the reason the GitHub repo is
// (githubAutolink.ts `repo`): a dozen memoizing call sites, one project per page, and the board is the
// source — set from its own door (store.ts setBoard/seedBoard), notified so memoized HTML rebuilds.
