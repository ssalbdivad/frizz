// The ```lightbox fence: a worker lists image and video files, one per line, and Frizz renders them as
// ONE gallery the human can click through (components/Lightbox.tsx) instead of a stack of full-width
// frames — in the transcript, and on every card and reader that renders a worker's Markdown. It is THE
// way a worker shows the human a picture: a picture a tool returned folds into the collapsed tool digest
// (lib/toolActivity.isToolActivityException), and only a fence puts one in front of the human.
//
//   ```lightbox
//   /tmp/shots/before.png  Before the fix
//   /tmp/shots/after.png   After the fix
//   /tmp/shots/flow.webm   The whole flow, recorded
//   ```
//
// A line is a path and, optionally, a caption after it. The grammar is deliberately FORGIVING, because a
// worker writes it from memory and the shapes it reaches for are all unambiguous: a bare path, a
// backticked path, a list item, and the Markdown image the worker contract already teaches
// (`![caption](/abs/shot.png)`). A caption may lead with a separator (`—`, `-`, `|`, `:`) and may be
// quoted; both are stripped. Paths with spaces work — a macOS "Screen Shot … at 1.23.45 PM.png" is the
// common case — because the path ends at the first image or video extension, not at the first space.
//
// Pure string logic, no DOM: the splitter in imagePaths.ts runs it during render and the tests run it
// under `node --test`. RESOLVING a path to a file the image proxy will serve happens in
// `resolveLightboxPath`, against the project root, exactly as a Markdown link's destination does.
