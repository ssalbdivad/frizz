// stacking level, so a caller applies EXACTLY ONE z utility on top (never two conflicting z-* classes
// on one element — Tailwind resolves same-property collisions by CSS source order, not class order,
// so stacking z-[110] and z-[250] would be a coin-flip). Motion-free (no pop-in) by contract.

// THE STACKING ORDER, low → high. The sidebar/board rail deliberately has NO z-index (default
// stacking): it and the workpane are side-by-side columns that never overlap, and its old desktop
// z-[100] is what forced every overlay to escalate past it — the recurring "hidden underneath the
// prompt box" bug. Anything below is an OVERLAY and therefore already outranks the rail:
//   z-20  fixed corner chrome · 50 + 2·depth the drawer stack (a layer's scrim; a thread's panel one above)
//   aboveDrawersZ(n) the New thread dialog and the ⌘K palette · z-[70] toasts
//   z-[110] portaled selector surfaces · z-[200] shared Dialog · z-[250] anchored popovers/tooltips
//   z-[260] a selector opened from INSIDE a popover · z-[300] restart scrim (alone must cover the whole app)
// Never re-elevate a persistent layer to "win" a collision — raise the specific overlay instead.

// THE TIER JUST ABOVE THE DRAWER STACK, for a modal that can be opened over an open drawer: the New thread
// dialog (`c`, the palette's New thread, an editor's New thread button) and the ⌘K palette. Drawers climb
// two steps a layer (DrawerStack: a layer at depth d paints its scrim at 50 + 2d and a thread's panel at
// 51 + 2d), so a fixed z loses to a deep enough stack: the dialog sat at z-50 and the palette at z-[60], and
// with a thread open the dialog painted UNDER it — invisible in an editor's sidebar while its textarea held
// focus, so typing went into a box nobody could see (2026-10-01). One step above the top layer instead: the
// returned z is the scrim's and the next one up the panel's.
//
// Never the shared z-[200] tier, which looks like the obvious fix: the pickers these surfaces open (the
// model/effort grid, every menu) are z-[110] portals and would land beneath them, and toasts (z-[70]) would
// vanish behind the scrim. So the tier is capped below toasts — reached only past nine open drawers, where a
// dialog under the tenth beats a toast nobody can read.
