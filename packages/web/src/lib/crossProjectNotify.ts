// DESKTOP NOTIFICATIONS FOR EVERY PROJECT, not only the one the page is bound to.
//
// A `notify` event is published on its PROJECT's bus (server board.ts notifyNeedsYou) and reaches a page
// only over that project's socket. Until 2026-09-28 every project had its own tab, so an operator with
// one tab per project heard from all of them. The one page binds ONE feed (routes.tsx useProjectBinding)
// and reads every other project through the `projectsQueues` poll — which raised nothing, so a thread
// that queued in any project but the focused one queued silently.
//
// This watches that same poll and raises the notification the other project's own tab would have: a
// session thread that newly ENTERS a queue (the server's edge, needsYou false → true, read as queued
// false → true), for every project except the bound one, whose socket already carries its own. Titled and
// bodied as the server titles it, and TAGGED by the thread's own address (`/all/<project>/<slug>`) exactly
// as the socket path tags it — the tag is the browser's replace key, so a second tab, or the socket of a
// tab bound to that project, raising the same thread replaces this notification instead of adding one.
//
// The first read is a baseline, and so is a project's first appearance in a read: a page that opens onto
// a full queue, or a project that has just been opened, is not news.

 * The threads that entered a queue since `prev`, and the sightings to compare the next read against.
 * `prev` null is the first read: everything is baseline. A thread that leaves the board and comes back
 * arrives again, as the server forgets a vanished thread so its reappearance re-notifies.
 *
 * EXCEPT ONE THAT COMES BACK TO THE PLACE IT LEFT WITH THE REST IT LEFT WITH (2026-09-30), the server's own
 * rule (board.ts notifyNeedsYou, `resumed`) mirrored here so the two notifiers agree. Nobody acted on the
 * thread (the queue clock gave it its old place back, which only an unbroken claim does) and its worker
 * said nothing new, so a notification would announce a card the human was already told about. The case
 * that made it matter: a spinoff asked for on another project's queued card (the All queues page's
 * SpinoffButton) takes that parent out of the queue for its side turn — a cold resume plus the spawn,
 * several of this poll's 3s reads — and the side turn puts the same rest back (spinoff-side-turn.ts), so
 * this watcher saw an absent → present edge and raised a desktop notification for nothing. A re-entry that
 * comes back with a NEW urgent reason — a permission prompt, a question, a crash it did not leave with —
 * still notifies whatever its place and rest: the queue clock gives the old place back to an urgent entry
 * too, and a Codex approval moves no rest, so "same place, same rest" cannot tell a new blocking ask from
 * nothing happening. The reasons are compared whole (queueUrgency), the server's own rule: a parent resting
 * on a question keeps that question through its side turn and must stay as quiet as a plain handoff — the
 * first cut exempted anything urgent, and announced exactly that parent while the server stayed silent.
