// Clickable inline-code file paths. Agent prose often mentions files in backticks (`~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`,
// `packages/web/src/App.tsx`). When the text of an inline `<code>` resolves to a real file on disk under
// the server's openable roots, we tag it so the app-wide local-file click interceptor opens it in the
// user's editor/default app — same mechanism as a Markdown file link, just discovered from bare code.
//
// The existence check is a server round-trip (the browser can't stat), so this runs as a POST-render
// decoration: classify candidates locally to avoid statting every backtick, batch the unknowns to the
// server, and tag the ones that come back real. Resolutions are cached for the session.

// A bare filename: a stem, then ONE extension that opens with a letter (`cloudflare-ask.md`,
// `package.json`, `App.tsx`). The letter rule is what keeps a version (`1.2`, `v1.2`) and an
// abbreviation (`e.g.`, which ends on its dot) out. A member access (`Promise.resolve`) still matches;
// the server says no and it stays plain code, at the cost of one batched, cached round-trip.

// reference in a Windows worker's prose looks like, and until the Windows audit (2026-09-11, finding
// 12) none of them ever became a link because the test below asked for a `/`. The segment class is
// deliberately narrow: inline code is full of backslashes that are NOT paths (`\n`, `\d+`, `\\`), and
// each one this admits costs a batched round-trip the server answers with "no". A leading backslash
// that is not a UNC pair is an escape, not a root. The pattern still admits an editor `:line[:col]`
// suffix, but localFileCandidate splits any position off before asking, so the server only ever sees

// \`cloudflare-ask.md\``), which reads as a link and, until 2026-08-25, was the one file reference in
// prose that never became one. Bare words and shell commands are excluded so we never stat
