// THE CARD'S COPY, for a fence that is now PURE STRUCTURE.
//
// What these replaced was a matrix: every hint kind had a park action ("Scheduled snooze", "Awaiting
// human"), a synthesized sentence ("Wait for Alice", "Scheduled for tomorrow at 9"), and a snooze target
// derived from whatever instant the worker had typed. All of it is gone with the kinds — a worker no
// longer describes its wait in prose frizz has to parse back, it NAMES things frizz can look up, and it
// writes exactly one line for a human. So there is nothing left to synthesize and nothing to get wrong.
//
// `awaitingParkAction` — the reader that turned a hint kind into a button — went with the last caller on
// 2026-09-04: it had returned null for every fence since 2026-08-15, and the awaiting card it fed was
// folded into the resting card (AwaitingBackgroundCard), whose park is the ordinary Snooze and has never
// depended on a fence. `awaitingPresentationLine` went the same day, for the same reason: ONE card reads
// the body now, through awaitingProseBlock, and it decides for itself what an empty one says.
