// THE PHONE'S TRIAGE LOOP: open the top row, read, answer or Done, repeat — without the board in

// needs you, in the order the phone's queue lists them; when nothing is left it goes back to the board.
// An Undo toast puts the thread back.
//
// One module, because two surfaces fire it: the thread's bottom bar (the Done button) and the thread's
// ⋯ sheet. Both must pick the same next thread and restore the same way, so neither owns a copy.

 * The phone queue, top to bottom: pinned first, then the asks, then everything else in the queue's own
