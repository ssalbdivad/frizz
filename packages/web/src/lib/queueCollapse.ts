// Whether a message sitting mid-span keeps its own row instead of collapsing into the summary divider.
//
//   - A ```question. An ask the agent kept working past is a decision the human still owes; collapsing it
//     left the card offering "Send answers" with no question in sight, and the same ask answerable one
//     click away in the drawer. A SUPERSEDED copy is the exception — the newer one carries the decision.
//   - The message carrying a successful DONE REGISTRATION (`carriesDoneRegistration`). It is a resting
//     message in everything but the divider that marks one — the registration is the sign-off — so it
//     falls under the maintainer's standing rule that every rested message is shown. It renders textOnly
//     through the collapse branch like an open ask (NOT the lifted-wake ordinary path — that would paint
//     the fold divider below prose it summarizes, the 2026-08-13 inversion), so its own tool band stays
//     folded and counted while its prose survives.
//   - A SCHEDULER WAKE (`wake: true` — a PR-watcher delivery, a timer, a watcher, AND the Goal's own bump).
//     It names WHAT RE-INVOKED THE AGENT, and NOTHING ELSE on the card represents it. Hiding it left a
//     card that showed a park on a PR watcher and then, with nothing in between, more work — reading as
//     a watcher wake that had never happened (maintainer 2026-08-12: "there's no indication of the PR
//     Watcher triggering and actually causing the additional follow-ups").
//
//     THE GOAL'S OWN BUMP IS NO LONGER THE EXCEPTION, which reverses a call made on 2026-08-12 ("do not
//     include 'Agent rested' above it or the stop hook firing"). That exemption was written when a rest
//     did not CUT: the bump's hairline had no rested message above it to belong to, so it landed jammed
//     against the final handoff and read as part of it. Now that each rest closes a run, the bump sits
//     exactly where the maintainer asked for it — under the message the agent rested on, naming why
//     there is more below (2026-08-16: "Anytime the agent does additional work after an awaiting block
//     or a done block or what have you, there should be a hairline beneath it telling it what woke up
//     the chat"). Measured on the thread that produced that ask (zod
//     `dedupe-zod-6236-exactoptional-with-coercion-2-prs`): all three wakes were Goal bumps, the card
//     drew none of them, and the maintainer read the resumed work as an unexplained PR-watcher firing.
//     The `rest` divider itself stays dropped — the rested message above the hairline says it better.
//
// A `boundary:"wake"` COMPLETION divider — a background task or sub-agent finishing — does not survive
// HERE, and its position decides it instead: see `CollapseSegment.waker` below. Mid-run it is chatter,
// because the agent was already working and the completion changed nothing about why; the run's own fold
// carries it. At the HEAD of a run it is the waker, and it draws its hairline like any other.
//
// That split replaces a flat "never survives" rule whose stated reason had quietly expired. It was
// dropped because "its LAUNCH card is already lifted out of this same span" (2026-08-12), so keeping the
// completion rendered one event twice and inverted — the completions flow in transcript order while the
// launches were one synthesized row at the foot of the span. Later the same day the launches were folded
// IN (a queue card gives no background task a card of its own), so nothing on the card stood for the
// event any more, and a run could begin with no statement of what began it — the exact gap the 2026-08-16
// ask names.
//
// The counting walk and the render loop BOTH go through this, so the divider can never promise the
// expansion a message it is already showing.

// wake the card chose not to narrate — the Goal's bump, which is how nearly every frizz-driven thread is
// resumed — cut nothing, so every turn it drove merged into ONE run whose fold hid all but the first and
// last prose in it. On the maintainer's zod thread that swallowed the whole answer to the question he had
// just asked: he asked about a field, the agent answered it and rested, the Goal woke it twice more, and
// the card showed the stale message above his ask, one fold, and the last turn's summary — the answer
// itself inside the fold (2026-08-16: "the entire answer to that question was collapsed by default").
//
// So the rule is now the one he stated: "you should show all of the resting messages, but then all of the
// stuff between them can be collapsed." Every message the agent RESTED on is a run's closing prose and is
// therefore shown; the run behind it folds; the wake that started the next run draws its own hairline
// between the two. A wake still cuts as well, because a wake can arrive mid-turn (a watcher firing while
// the agent works) with no rest to cut on.
//
// The card used to compute a single span — the agent's first prose after the human's ask through its
// last prose anywhere — and hang one divider off it. Wakes were lifted OUT of that span but did not
// SPLIT it, so a thread frizz had driven across five wakes rendered as: opening prose, five hairlines in
// a row, one fold, closing prose. Every hairline was detached from the work it explained, and the fold
// claimed a single run for five separate ones.
//
// A rest — and a wake — now CUTS. Each segment is [what re-invoked the agent → the prose it rested on],
// folds its own calls, and shows its own closing message, so the card reads down the page as it ran
// (maintainer 2026-08-12: "collapse everything starting at the point where the watcher was triggered up
// until it comes to rest… multiple messages in their complete form, with various collapsed tool call
// blocks between them, plus some hairline indicators showing why they were reawoken").
//
// THE SEGMENT SPANS THE WHOLE RUN, not just [open..close]. Calls made after the closing prose used to
// sit outside the fold and render as raw rows at the foot of the card — the tail of exactly the ordering
// the maintainer reported ("a bunch of bash calls show up right at the end"). They are the same run's
// work and they fold with it.
