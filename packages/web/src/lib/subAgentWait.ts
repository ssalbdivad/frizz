// ── A QUEUED PARENT'S SUB-AGENT WAIT — what its card says about the batch it fanned out ──────────────
//
// A parent that dispatched several background sub-agents is re-invoked by each one's return, and a rest
// that is not an honoured park queues (a partial return may give the human something to act on). So the
// queue meets the same parent once per return, and until 2026-09-29 its card said only "Awaiting" over the
// worker's prose — nothing about which children were still out, which had come back, or why it was back.
// The pure half of that card lives here, beside the words it puts on screen, so a test can pin them
// without a DOM (AwaitingSubAgentsCard draws them).
