// THE RAIL'S EDITED FILES AS A TREE (maintainer 2026-09-03: "maybe we could do a file tree here
// instead. with a tiny indent per-level. would help organize this and show more context … you can
// collapse paths if there's a chain of directories, similar to github").
//
// The flat list showed basenames alone — a 340px rail cannot hold a repo path, and truncating one
// from the end lost the part that names the file — so twenty-two rows read as twenty-two names with
// no idea where any of them lived. A tree gives each name its directory once, above it, and the
// indent says how deep.
//
// A CHAIN OF DIRECTORIES WITH ONE CHILD EACH IS ONE ROW, joined with `/`, exactly as GitHub's file
// tree draws `packages/web/src` when nothing branches off `packages` or `web`. A directory holding a
// file as well as one subdirectory does branch — the file is a sibling — so it keeps its own row.
//
// Paths under the project directory are shown relative to it; anything else (a file under `~`, a
// scratch file in /tmp) keeps its absolute path, rooted at `/`, and collapses the same way. A Windows
// path (`C:\Users\x\proj\src\a.ts`, which is how Claude Code and Codex report every file there) splits
// on either separator, so it nests instead of standing as one flat node carrying the whole path
// (Windows audit 2026-09-11, finding 12); outside the project its drive is the first segment, so the
// collapsed row reads `C:/Users/x/.claude` — the tree joins with `/` and Windows accepts it.
//
// Order is GitHub's: directories before files, each set alphabetical, case-insensitive — not the
// list's most-recently-edited-first, because a tree that reorders itself on every save cannot be
// read. Recency has to come back some other way if it is wanted; it was never what the tree is for.

// A directory's `path` is its segments from the tree's root, joined with `/` — unique where `name` is
// not: `one/lib` and `two/lib` both draw a row named `lib` at the same depth, and the rail keys on it.
