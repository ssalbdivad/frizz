// base-path.ts). Focused on a project (lib/pageView.ts), that is the project the page shows. Showing All
// projects — the home, and where every launch lands — it is the prompt box's own setting, like its model
// (maintainer 2026-09-28), resolved by defaultCrossProjectFocus below: the operator's own pick in this
// browser, else the project they last focused here, else the one `frizz` was last run in, else the one
// opened most recently.
//
// Remembered by ID, not slug: a rename changes the slug, and a remembered slug that no longer resolves
// would quietly fall back to another project.

// projects is bound to the last project they did choose — in the prompt box's picker, or the project they
// were focused on when they chose All projects — and closing the last drawer, which goes home, is going
// back to it. One per BROWSER, unlike the view: it is a default for a box, not a place.

 * is bumped by any registration — adding a project from the page, a stack registering its tenants after
 * boot — so a launch from `storefront` aimed the box at `billing-api` and a task landed in the wrong repo.
 *
 * `openIds`, when known, narrows every step to projects whose board this server has open: a project another
 * Frizz serves, or one that failed to open, can be focused but never takes a thread, and landing on it
 * showed a prompt box that never arrived. It only narrows — with none open (a boot still opening them)
