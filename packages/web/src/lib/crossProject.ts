// base-path.ts). Focused on a project (lib/pageView.ts), that is the project the page shows. Showing All
// projects — the home, and where every launch lands — it is the prompt box's own setting, like its model
// (maintainer 2026-09-28), resolved by defaultCrossProjectFocus below: the operator's own pick in this
// browser, else the project they last focused here, else the one `frizz` was last run in, else the one
// opened most recently.
//
// Remembered by ID, not slug: a rename changes the slug, and a remembered slug that no longer resolves
// would quietly fall back to another project.

// projects is bound to the last project they did choose — in the prompt box's picker, or the project they
// were focused on when they chose All projects — and closing the last drawer, which goes home, is going
// back to it. One per BROWSER, unlike the view: it is a default for a box, not a place.

 *      for All projects);
 *   2. else the project they last FOCUSED in this browser (`lastFocusedId`);
 *   3. else the project `frizz` was most recently RUN in, cold or joining (`lastLaunchedAt`, which only
 *      the launcher stamps);
 *   4. else the project opened most recently, which is also the list's own order until someone arranges it.
 *
 * Each step takes only a project that is still registered and whose directory still exists; else none (no
 * usable project — the page then shows the welcome, where one is added).
 *
 * Step 3 exists because every launch lands on All projects at a bare `/` (97fb6c42), so the address no
 * longer says where `frizz` was run. Without it a browser with no pick fell to step 4, and `lastOpenedAt`
 * is bumped by any registration — adding a project from the page, a stack registering its tenants after
 * boot — so a launch from `storefront` aimed the box at `billing-api` and a task landed in the wrong repo.
 *
 * `openIds`, when known, narrows every step to projects whose board this server has open: a project another
 * Frizz serves, or one that failed to open, can be focused but never takes a thread, and landing on it
 * showed a prompt box that never arrived. It only narrows — with none open (a boot still opening them)
 * the page lands as it would without the list.

// button that would easily allow you to visually filter which projects you're looking at"):
