// element that does not scroll. A SPAN rather than a div for the reason markdown.ts's frameImage gives —
// this HTML is re-parsed by the browser when a surface injects it, and a non-phrasing wrapper makes the
// parser restructure the block around it; `.md-code` supplies the display/position it needs.
//
// The button carries no inline `<svg>`: the sanitizer drops svg WITH its subtree, so both glyphs (copy,
// and the check the delegated handler swaps to) are lucide paths carried as mask-image data URIs in
// styles.css, exactly as the markdown task marks are.
