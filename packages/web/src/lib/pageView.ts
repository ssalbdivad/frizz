// THE PAGE'S VIEW — which projects the one page shows: ONE project (its board, the default) or every
// project (All projects).
//
// A project's BOARD is the default (David asked for it 2026-10-06, on Colin's case in the standups of
// 2026-10-01 and 10-06: projects stay separate, as in Claude, ChatGPT and T3; one sidebar of every project
// loses the five bands and does not scale to his 17 projects and ~70 threads; Frizz's design goal is
// progressive focus). It is
// Colin McDonnell's one project per page, Frizz's original shape: the list is that project's, banded as his
// sidebar banded it (ProjectBoard.tsx), the queue shows its cards, and the prompt box dispatches into it.
// All projects — every project's list and one queue across all of them, with the prompt box's own picker
// — stays, one click away (the switcher's first entry, the board's home crumb, the rail's top door), but
// is no longer home. It was home at a bare `/` from 2026-09-30 (maintainer: "by default frizz should open
// the all projects view") until then.
//
// THE VIEW IS THE PATH, so every tab, bookmark and launch keeps its own, and a link says what it opens:
//
//   /                           no view of its own: where this browser was last (lastViewHref below), or
//                               on a phone its projects list (PhonePage.tsx)
//   /all                        All projects
//   /all/<slug>/thread/<t>      All projects, with that thread's drawer over it
//   /project/<slug>             that project's board — the launcher opens its own project's
//   /project/<slug>/thread/<t>  the board, with that thread open (its card, or its drawer)
//   /project/<slug>/status/<s>  the board's status list
//
// `/project/<slug>` is Colin's own scheme (upstream singleton-frizz.md: `?project=` was considered there and
// rejected), restored 2026-10-06 (David: the fork is the base, and everything Colin decided is in it —
// plans/upstream-superset.md §2). From 2026-09-29 to then the board was a QUERY on `/` (`/?project=<slug>`,
// first spelled `?focus=`), and a drawer's address could not say which view it sat on, so each tab kept
// its view in sessionStorage. The path says it now, so there is nothing left for a tab to remember; the
// old queries redirect to the path (routes.tsx, legacyViewRedirect below).
