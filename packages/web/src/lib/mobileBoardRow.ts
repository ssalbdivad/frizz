// THE PHONE BOARD ROW'S SECOND LINE — what the thread wants, in one line.
//
// The approved phone design (2026-09-30) gives every row one line under its title, and the line answers
// a different question per state: the QUESTION for an ask, the live ACTIVITY for a running thread, the
// start of the HANDOFF for a rested one. Pure functions over a ThreadView, so the rules are testable
// without a browser and the component stays a layout.
//
// WHAT THE ROW HAS TO WORK WITH. The ThreadView carries the registered questions whole (`questions`),
// the native ask's questions (`pendingAsk`), the newest tool call still awaiting its result (`liveTool`,
// Claude session threads — tailer.ts trackLiveTools), the worker's gerund (`activity`, legacy thread
// files only), and two readings of the newest assistant text: `lastAssistantLine`, its real first line
// with the markdown intact, and `lastAssistant`, a whitespace-collapsed ~200-char preview. The handoff
// line reads the first; the preview is only the fallback for a view without it, and there `handoffLine`
// approximates the line by stopping where the next block (a bullet, a fence, a heading) would have
// begun, because the preview's newlines are already spaces.
