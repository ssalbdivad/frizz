// Where a relative path written in prose points. Agents name files the way they typed them into a
// shell — `packages/web/src/App.tsx`, `.frizz/threads/<id>/HANDOFF.md`, `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` — and the
// server has always resolved those against the project directory for a path in INLINE CODE
// (local-file.ts `resolveOpenableFile`, behind rpc.resolveLocalPaths). A path written as a Markdown
// LINK had no such base in chat, so it stayed a relative href and the browser resolved it against the
// PAGE: clicking one navigated to a path under the page's own address and out of the app.
//
// Module-level rather than an argument threaded through every `mdToHtml` call, for exactly the reason
// githubAutolink.ts holds its repo that way: a page is FOCUSED on one project at a time, there are a
// dozen render sites each memoizing on its own markdown string, and a focus change tears every one of
// them down (resetProjectState). Set from the board — the one payload that carries both values. This is
// the focus's base, which is right for its drawers; Everything's lanes render other projects' prose on
// the same page, and name each one's own base through MarkdownScopeContext (lib/useMarkdown.ts).
//
// It NOTIFIES, and that is load-bearing, not defensive: a thread's transcript is its own query and it
// resolves BEFORE the board keyframe, so HTML memoized on the markdown string alone would be built
// while this was still empty and nothing would ever invalidate it. useMarkdownHtml subscribes so the
// base is a real render input. (Measured for the repo autolinker in exactly that shape — see
// githubAutolink.ts `setGithubRepo`.)
