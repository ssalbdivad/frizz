// A TOOL CALL THAT IS WAITING ITS TURN IS NOT RUNNING.
//
// Claude Code runs the tool calls of ONE assistant message in BATCHES: a run of consecutive
// concurrency-safe calls runs together, every other call runs alone, and each batch starts only once the
// batch before it has returned. So a TaskStop issued in the same message as a foreground `nub run
// typecheck && nub --test …` sat queued for 6m 24s and then took 0.9s (session fe5967ef, 2026-10-02) —
// while its card, timed from the message's own timestamp like every card in it, read "RUNNING · 4m 56s"
// and the human asked what TaskStop was doing for five minutes. Its finished card then read "done ·
// 6m 24s" for a sub-second stop.
//
// The batch rule is Claude Code's own, read out of the shipped binary (claude-agent-sdk 0.3.282, each
// tool's `isConcurrencySafe`): TRUE for Read, Grep, Glob, WebFetch, Monitor, Agent and TaskStop; TRUE for
// Bash only when its command is read-only, and for an MCP tool only with `readOnlyHint` (Frizz's own MCP
// tools carry no annotations, so they run serially); FALSE — the default — for everything else (Edit,
// Write, Skill, SendMessage, Workflow, ToolSearch…). WebSearch is not in that read; it is treated as safe
// because transcripts show it finishing before an earlier WebFetch.
//
// Two things the browser cannot know exactly, and which way each errs:
// - Whether a Bash command is read-only. Claude decides with its own parser; here a short allowlist of
//   read-only programs stands in, and anything it does not recognise counts as NOT safe. A read-only
//   command it misses can show a later pending call as queued while it really runs beside it — only for
//   as long as both are pending, which for two read-only commands is moments.
// - Whether a pending call has already RETURNED. A detached Bash (`backgroundState`), an Agent, a Workflow
//   and a Monitor all stay "pending" on their card long after their tool_result came back, so none of them
//   is taken to hold up the calls after it. A FOREGROUND Agent does hold them; missing that leaves a card
//   reading "running" exactly as it did before this rule existed, never a false "queued".
//
// Claude only. Codex runs a turn's parallel calls concurrently and maps its exec calls to "Bash" too, so
// this rule would mislabel them; the caller gates on the thread's backend.
