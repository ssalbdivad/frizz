// THE QUEUE BUILDS AND LAYS OUT ONLY THE CARDS NEAR THE SCREEN. Every card keeps its slot in the DOM, at its
// place and its height — `j`/`k`, the rail's scroll-to, the viewport lock (lib/viewportLock.ts), the ghost
// gap and the scrollspy all read slots, and every slot is there — but what is INSIDE a slot is paid for only
// near the screen:
//
//   1. A card far from the screen is not BUILT until it is needed: its slot holds a stand-in of the guessed
//      height (AllQueuesCard.tsx CardStandIn), and the card proper — its queries, its markdown, its reply
//      box — mounts the moment the slot comes within a viewport of the screen, or earlier, a card at a time
//      in idle time (`step`, below), so a page left alone ends up with every card built and find-in-page
//      reaching every word.
//   2. A built card far from the screen is SKIPPED by the browser: `content-visibility: auto` (styles.css
//      `.frizz-card-slot`) — no style, layout or paint — and sized from the height it had the last time it
//      was drawn (`contain-intrinsic-size: auto`).
//
// WHY: with hundreds of cards the page was bound by building them and laying them out. Measured 2026-10-02
// on a 244-card mirror of the maintainer's machine, prod build, a loaded 16-core WSL box: a cold load spent
// 7s in ONE task mounting all 244 cards (React render + commit, 244 handoff fetches started from inside it),
// and a 15s trace of load + settle spent 4.9s in Layout and 2.6s in PrePaint, every forced layout — a
// composer snapping its height, a clamp checking its overflow — laying out all 244 cards.
//
// WHY NOT `content-visibility: auto` ON EVERY CARD, ALWAYS. It brings layout, style and PAINT containment
// with it even while the card is on screen, and paint containment clips everything a card draws outside
// its own box: its `shadow-lg`, the arrival ring's outline 2px outside the border (styles.css
// `[data-queue-flash]`), the leaving blur, and the reply box's `/` and `@` menus — which open BELOW the box
// when it sits near the top of the window and so hang past the card's bottom edge over the next one (it
// also makes each card a stacking context, so the next card would paint over that menu). So a card NEAR
// the screen — within a viewport of it — wears `data-near`, which turns content-visibility back off
// (styles.css): nothing a reader can see is ever contained. An IntersectionObserver keeps that mark
// current as the page scrolls.
//
// WHY NOT TRUE WINDOWING (unmounting what scrolls away, as @tanstack/react-virtual does). A card the reader
// has passed keeps its draft caret, its open "Show more", its focus, and its words for find-in-page; and the
// viewport lock, the ghost gap and the leaving fade all hold a card's slot at its real height. A card once
// built stays built, and content-visibility makes a built card that is off screen cost nothing to keep.
//
// A SKIPPED CARD STILL ANSWERS LAYOUT QUERIES — reading `scrollHeight` inside one makes the browser lay it
// out on the spot — so correctness never depends on any of this. Cost does: a composer snapping its
// height or a clamp measuring its body would force each far card's layout one at a time, which is the cost
// this exists to avoid. Those measurements wait for their card (`whenCardRendered`), and run before the
// frame in which the card is first drawn.
//
// AND EVERY CARD IS DRAWN ONCE, IN IDLE TIME (`step`). A card never drawn is sized from a 540px guess (the
// median card on that mirror: p10 315, p90 793), and a guess is wrong by hundreds of px either way. Left
// wrong, a glide to a far card (a rail click) would land and then snap by the sum of every guess it passed,
// the scrollbar would jitter as cards resolve, and scrolling UP through cards never seen would keep the
// viewport lock correcting for cards growing above the reader. So after load the far cards are built and
// drawn a card at a time — off screen, with their measurements — and kept for a couple of frames, long
// enough for `contain-intrinsic-size: auto` to remember their real height. From then on every skipped card
// is the height it really is, and nothing on the page can tell it is skipped — and it STAYS that height
// through the three things that change a skipped card without a frame drawing it: content arriving in it
// (`ensureMutations`), the column changing width (`ensureSizes`), and the card being unmounted and mounted
// again (`drawnHeights`).
//
// AND EVERY CARD'S DATA IS FETCHED AHEAD OF ITS BUILD (`prefetch`). A card fetches its handoff when it is
// built, and a handoff lands a round trip later and grows the card from the server's 200-character preview
// to its clamped body — so every card built on the spot (a jump to the bottom, a key landing far down) grew
// under the reader a moment after it was drawn: End left the last card pushed 1,234px off the bottom of the
// 243-card mirror (review 2026-10-02), and a key landing on a card never auto-pressed its "Show more", which
// did not exist yet. Fetching is cheap next to building — no render, no layout — so the handoffs are read a
// few at a time from the first idle moment, as main read them all at mount, and a card built later builds
// with its handoff in hand, at its real height in its first frame.

// A JUMP IS DRAWN BEFORE IT PAINTS. The observer reports after a frame has painted, so a jump past the
// margin it watches — the scrollbar dragged, End, Page Down, a scroll restored — painted the cards it landed
// on as stand-ins (a frame and title) for a frame, then re-laid the page around the built cards, which are
// rarely the 540px guessed: measured 2026-10-02 on the 244-card mirror, a jump to the middle before the
// page was built showed 2 stand-ins in the first painted frame, and the next frame put a different card
// under the reading line (the card read moved from -132px to 158px). A scroll event is dispatched in the
// rendering step BEFORE animation frames, layout and the ResizeObserver the viewport lock corrects from,
// so building what is on screen here means the first frame painted after a jump is the real cards, and the
// lock takes its anchor (in its own animation frame) on the page as it will be drawn. Only the window
// itself, not the observer's margin: a scrollbar drag fires this every frame, and each card built costs
// 10–30ms on a loaded box, so this builds what must be seen now and leaves the rest to the observer.
// Cheap once nothing is left to do: one box read per slot not already near, from a layout a scroll does not
// dirty.
//
// AGAIN UNTIL NOTHING NEW IS ON SCREEN: a card built at its real height rarely keeps the 540px it was
// guessed at, so building one moves the cards after it — and at the bottom of the page, where a shorter page
// clamps the scroll, the cards before it — and can bring another stand-in on screen (the 60-card fixture:
// one of three after a single pass). Each pass is one layout, which the frame pays anyway; bounded, so a
// page that keeps changing under it cannot hold the frame.
//
// AND A JUMP TO THE END STAYS AT THE END. The cards it lands on were guessed at 540px and are built at their
// real height, so the page's end moves; the viewport lock then holds the card at its reading line, a third
// of the way down, and every px the cards below that line gained pushed the end off screen — End showed the
// second-last card cut off, 1,234px short on the 243-card mirror (review 2026-10-02). So a page that was at
// its end before this built anything is put back at its new end, here, before the lock re-takes its anchor
// in its animation frame. Only then: a page merely scrolled to its end, building nothing, is left alone, and
// cards built later — the observer's, a viewport out — sit above the reading line, where the lock's hold
// keeps the end where it is.
//
// AND HELD THERE FOR A MOMENT (`holdEnd`): the cards a jump to the end lands on are built at once, but a
// card's handoff can still be on its way — the prefetch below reads them in page order, so the end of a long
// page comes last (on the loaded mirror every handoff had landed only ~25s after load) — and it grows the
// card by hundreds of px a round trip later, below the reading line again: End landed on the end, then
// slid 246px, then 493px, off it. So for END_HOLD_MS after a jump to the end, a card changing height puts
// the page back at its end (in the slots' ResizeObserver, after layout and before paint, so it is never
// seen off it). The reader's own move ends the hold at once: a wheel, a touch, a press, a key, or a scroll UP
// from where the hold last left the page. Not merely being off the end: a card growing below moves the end,
// not the page, and a scroll event can see that before the observer has put the page back.
