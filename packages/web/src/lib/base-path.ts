// WHICH PROJECT THIS PAGE IS SHOWING, taken from its own URL.
//
// One Frizz per machine serves every project from one origin, so the URL names the project:
// `/project/nub/thread/fix-auth`. That works precisely because Frizz's own routes were moved under
// `/_frizz/` — the top-level namespace is otherwise free, so a first segment is either the SPA's own
// route or the `project` segment, and nothing else. (`/nub/thread/x` — the project at the ROOT — was
// the shape considered and rejected; see PROJECT_SEGMENT below for why it cost too much.)
//
// AN EMPTY BASE IS A SUPPORTED STATE, not a bug: the launching project is still served unprefixed at
// `/thread/<slug>` and `/status/<name>`, which is what lets the server land slug routing without a
// lockstep rewrite of this file, and what keeps every pre-singleton bookmark resolving. It is a legacy
// INBOUND alias, not a shape to MINT — see `outerPath`/`projectHref`. Note it does NOT include `/`,
// which is the cross-project page; the launching project's queue reaches its board through
// `queueDestination` (lib/router.ts) instead.
//
// TWO PREFIXES NAME A PROJECT, and they differ only in MODE. `/project/<slug>` is that project's BOARD
// (single-project mode). `/all/<slug>/thread/<t>` is a thread drawer open on the CROSS-PROJECT page —
// every project's queue on one page, which itself lives at bare `/`. The page is always FOCUSED on one
// project — the one its prompt box dispatches into — and the focus IS the page project, so every helper
// below answers the same for both modes (the same API base, the same live feed, the same cache scope),
// which is what lets the board's whole drawer stack and composer work on the cross-project page
// unchanged. Only `basePath` keeps the mode, so a URL built on one page stays in that page's mode.
//
// AT `/` THE FOCUS IS NOT IN THE URL. Where a new thread goes is a setting of the prompt box, like its
// model, not an address (maintainer 2026-09-28: "should not be reflected as a top-level url route like
// this: /all/frizz"). The route resolves it — the operator's remembered pick (lib/crossProject.ts) —
// and hands it here with `setHomeFocus`, so `/` answers as `/all/<focus>` did. A drawer's URL still
// names its thread's project, because that is the thread's address, not the box's target.
