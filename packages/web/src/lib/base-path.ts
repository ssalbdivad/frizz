// WHICH PROJECT THIS PAGE IS SHOWING, taken from its own URL.
//
// One Frizz per machine serves every project from one origin, and ONE PAGE shows them. Its PATH names its
// view (lib/pageView.ts), and with it the project the page is bound to:
//
//   /                              where this browser was last (a redirect), or a phone's projects list —
//                                  bound to the prompt box's pick (below)
//   /all                           All projects — bound to the prompt box's pick (below)
//   /all/<slug>/thread/<t>         All projects with that thread's drawer open — bound to its project
//   /project/<slug>                that project's board, the default (Colin's scheme, restored 2026-10-06)
//   /project/<slug>/thread/<t>     the board with that thread open (its card, or its drawer)
//   /project/<slug>/status/<s>     the board's status list (StatusListView.tsx)
//
// and either thread address plus `/full` is that thread's fullscreen page. That works because Frizz's own
// routes live under `/_frizz/`, so the top-level namespace is the SPA's.
//
// `/project/<slug>` was retired on 2026-09-28, when one page replaced the project view and focus mode moved
// into the query (`/?project=<slug>`); it came back as the project board's address on 2026-10-06 (David:
// the fork is the base, with Colin's `/project/<slug>` scheme, plans/upstream-superset.md §2), and the query
// now only redirects to it (routes.tsx).
//
// AN EMPTY BASE IS A SUPPORTED STATE, not a bug: an unprefixed `/thread/<slug>/full` is the launching
// project's fullscreen page, and a page with no project at all (the welcome) has nothing to prefix.
//
// The page is always BOUND to one project — the page project: the board's project, All projects'
// prompt-box pick, or the one whose drawer is open — and every helper below answers for it (the same API
// base, the same live feed, the same cache scope), which is what lets the whole drawer stack and composer
// work for any project on the one page.
//
// AT `/all` (AND `/`) THE PAGE PROJECT IS NOT IN THE PATH. The route resolves it — the pick
// (lib/crossProject.ts) — and hands it here with `setHomeFocus`, so `/all` answers as `/all/<slug>` does. A
// drawer's URL still names its thread's project, because that is the thread's address.

 * every in-app link starts looking like a FILESYSTEM path to the markdown sanitizer, and renders as a
