// THE × ON A CHILD-OPERATION ROW — one action, for all three surfaces that list children.
//
// It means one of two honest things, decided by the row's own state (see `childOpDismisser`, which is
// where the control is withheld entirely when neither is true):
//   RUNNING  → STOP. The server ends the child through the provider's real control, then retires the row.
//   STALE/RESTED → CLEAR. Nothing is running to stop; this retires a finished op from tracking, which
//                  is the escape hatch the × was originally built for (a completion that never landed
//                  keeps a thread hostage through the Done-warning count).
//
// No optimism: the server refreshes the board after it has applied that policy. If a real stop throws,
// it deliberately does not retire the row; the error toast is the only client-side bookkeeping.
// (This lives beside `lib/childOps.ts` rather than inside it because that module is the row's pure
// vocabulary, importable by an SSR test with no store or transport behind it.)
//
// `api` is the thread's OWN project's client. It defaults to `rpc`, the project the address bar names,
// which is right for the drawer and the /full page; a row in Everything's project list names a thread of
// any project on a page that names at most one, so it passes its scope's client (api/threadApi.tsx) —
// else the × on another project's `fix-auth` child would stop the focused project's.
//
// Resolves to whether a live child was actually KILLED once the stop has settled, and never rejects (the
// toast is the whole error path), so a caller that shows the result — the agent-terminal drawer's Stop on
// a Codex exec — can re-read after it and say "stopped" only when it was.
// A MONITOR is a shell to the server, and stops the same way; only its name differs. Its row, tooltip and
// drawer all call it an "agent monitor", so its stop toast does too.

// WHICH rows may carry the ×, on every surface. Three independent reasons to withhold it, and the
// governing rule is the maintainer's (2026-07-30): "We shouldn't show the X if it doesn't fucking
// work." They hit it on a background SHELL, whose × cleared the row and then admitted in a toast that
// the work was probably still going — a control that lies about what it did.
//
//  1. NO ID / A DESCENDANT. Retiring acts on a tracked op BY ITS DISPATCH ID, and a descendant's
//     dispatch lives in an ANCESTOR's transcript — this thread never tracked it, so the call would be
//     a silent no-op. (`stopTask` alone could reach a descendant, but the row would then not clear,
//     which is the same lie in the other direction. The drawer's "Stop sub-agent" covers those.)
//  2. RUNNING, BUT NOT STOPPABLE. The row is live work frizz has no channel to end: any op on a
//     codex thread, or one whose provider task handle frizz never captured. `stoppable` is the
//     SERVER's answer and is never re-derived here — the policy depends on the thread's TRANSPORT,
//     which the browser has no honest way to know.
//
//     A background SHELL used to fall out of this clause BY CONSTRUCTION, because a BgShellView
//     carried no `stoppable` field at all — the server refused every shell stop categorically, on the
//     belief that frizz held no handle on the process. That was measured wrong on 2026-08-01: a
//     background Bash is a task in the same registry `Query.stopTask` addresses, and killing it is as
//     real as killing a sub-agent (server/backend/_live_shell_stop.mts). The field now exists on both
//     views and this clause reads them identically, which is the point — the ×'s availability is a
//     property of the ROW, never of what kind of thing the row is.
//  3. Everything else keeps the ×, including every stale/rested row: there the click CLEARS a finished
//     op, which is exactly what it claims and works on every runtime.
