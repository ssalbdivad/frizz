// THE PHONE BREAKPOINT, and why it is not the 800px one the layout already uses.
//
// The app has had a `max-[800px]` stack point for a long time: below it the sidebar and the workpane
// stop sitting side by side and stack vertically. That is a TABLET layout — the same surfaces, one
// above the other — and it is unchanged by anything here.
//
// This is a different question: below what width does the desktop's information model stop working at
// all? A 390pt viewport cannot hold a rail AND a workpane in any arrangement, so the phone gets its own
// layout of the page (components/PhonePage.tsx: a header, three tabs, one list) rather than a squeezed
// one. 700px is where that switch happens: wide enough that every phone in portrait and most in
// landscape get the phone layout, narrow enough
// that a small window on a desktop keeps the layout its user knows.
