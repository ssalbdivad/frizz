// What the prompt box makes of the model's answer and what each submit does with it (scheduleIntent.ts) — the
// 2026-10-06 design's D5, branch by branch, as pure steps: no trigger or a dismissed reading dispatches; a reading
// of exactly the current words creates or dispatches; no reading yet DEFERS — the words leave at once and their
// reading settles them, a failure or a refusal starting the thread with a note; Undo leaves the reading dismissed. And the strip: nothing without a schedule word, the reading of earlier words kept while new ones are
// read (stale-while-revalidate), a "no schedule" answer taking it away.
