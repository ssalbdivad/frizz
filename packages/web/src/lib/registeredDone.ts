// with `mcp__frizz__done` rather than wrote as a ```done fence.
//
// A fenced done is drawn where it was written: the transcript parses the final message and puts a
// FenceCard in place of the block (ChatView renderText). A registered done is in no message at all —
// the board synthesizes the fence off a `thread_done` row and every predicate treats the two alike
// (board.registeredDoneFence) — so nothing on the page drew it, and a thread that signed off by tool
// rested with prose and no card of any kind (maintainer 2026-08-27: "I don't see anything: any
// awaiting card or any question card or anything at all"). This is the rung that draws it, at the end
// of the ladder in both transcript paths and on the queue card.
//
// `lastAssistantText` is the dedupe: a worker that wrote the fence AND called the verb (the contract
// describes the tool as "that same body") would otherwise show the same card twice, once in the message
// and once here. The message's own card wins — it is already where the eye lands — and the registration
// still does what only it can: gate the sign-off and outlive the message.
