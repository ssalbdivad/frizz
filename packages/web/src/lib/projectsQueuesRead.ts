 * second read that changed anything on, `readStartedAt(queues.data)` answered undefined, for good. Both
 * of its readers then waited forever for a read they could never see (AllQueues.tsx): a project's queue
 * the page left — a drawer opened in place on another project's thread, then closed — stayed frozen at
 * that moment (useDepartedQueue), so a thread woken from anywhere else never drew its card again until a
 * reload (found 2026-10-06 by scripts/verify-all-queues.mjs, on main too); and a card acted on whose
 * thread stayed queued stayed hidden instead of coming back after REAPPEAR_MS (useLeavingCards). The
 * shared result is stamped with the read that produced it. When nothing changed that is the previous
 * array, re-stamped with the newer start, which is right: the cache now holds what a read that started
