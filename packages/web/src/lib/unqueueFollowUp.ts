// TAKING A SENT MESSAGE BACK.
//
// A follow-up sent to a working agent sits in the provider's command queue — visible in the chat as
// the gray bubble — until the agent picks it up, which is anywhere from seconds to (measured) hours.
// For that whole window the operator's own message is somewhere they cannot reach: the composer is
// empty, the words are on screen, and the only way to change their mind was to send a second message
// correcting the first. Clicking the bubble is the retraction: frizz asks the provider to drop it, and
// on a confirmed drop hands the text back to the prompt box where it can be edited and re-sent.
//
// The whole thing is worth nothing unless it is TRUTHFUL, so nothing here is optimistic. The bubble
// disappears only after the provider confirms the message left its queue; a refusal ("the agent
// already picked it up") leaves the bubble exactly where it is and says so. Silently clearing a bubble
// for a message the agent is about to read would be worse than not having the feature.

// Which surfaces can offer this at all. Only a Claude thread has a queue frizz holds a control channel
// into; a codex steer goes straight into the running turn, so there is never anything to take back and
// the affordance would be a dead click. (A LEGACY Claude row dispatched before the broker became the
// sole transport also can't — its text was typed into Claude Code's own TUI composer — but nothing
// distinguishes it from a broker row on the client, so that one refusal is surfaced as the server's
// reason rather than predicted here.)
