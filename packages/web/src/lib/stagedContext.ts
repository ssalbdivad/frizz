// SELECTED CONTEXT staged for a prompt box's next message: ⌘I over a selection in the file viewer
// (FileViewerPanel), or a selection sent from an editor window (lib/editorCompose.ts). Each item is the
// quote its `@` token stands for — the token sits in the draft prose, the item here — and on send the
// items serialize under the prose (composerContext.ts buildMessageWithContext). Every box that shows a
// draft paints its tokens as chips: a thread's reply box in the drawer and on the queue card, and the
// new-thread box.
//
// KEYED BY THE DRAFT KEY (lib/drafts.ts), not by the thread's slug, which is what it was keyed by until
// 2026-10-01. Staging belongs to exactly one draft — the one its token is typed into — and a draft key
// already says whose: a project's new-thread box, or one session of one thread in one project. A bare
// slug said neither, and slugs are unique only within a project, so the store had to forget every
// staged item on each project switch (resetProjectState) — which would also have forgotten the item an
// editor insert had just staged for the project the page was switching TO.
//
// PERSISTED BESIDE THE DRAFT, in this tab's sessionStorage, for the same reason the draft is. The token
// survives a reload in the draft; an item that did not would leave the token as bare text, and the send
// would carry `@a.ts:12-20` with no definition behind it — a reference the agent cannot resolve, typed
// by nobody. Memory-only was tolerable while every item was a ⌘I quote the human could re-make in two
// keystrokes; an editor selection cannot be re-made from the page at all.
