// WHERE A REGISTERED QUESTION SITS IN THE TRANSCRIPT: at the newest rest that CLAIMS it — the rest it
// was asked at, or a later rest whose ```awaiting fence names it under `questions:`. Never at a rest that
// says nothing about it.
//
// A ```question fence needs none of this — it IS a message, so it renders where it was written. A
// REGISTERED question is a row in `thread_question` with no message to live in, so its position is a
// decision, and it has been the wrong one three times:
//
// - Until 2026-08-27 the card was pinned above the composer. The moment the human replied past it, it
//   sat UNDER their own newest message and under everything the worker had done since, claiming to be
//   the current ask (maintainer 2026-08-27: "The questions should show up in the chat wherever the
//   session came to rest").
// - 2026-08-27 froze it at the rest that asked it — and then a worker that rested AGAIN with the
//   question open left the newest rest reading as a bare stop (maintainer 2026-08-31: "Why was this able
//   to come to rest without a proper handoff?").
// - 2026-08-31 therefore pulled every open question to the CURRENT rest. That took each card out of the
//   prose it was placed in and stacked them all under whatever the worker said last — a CI wake, an
//   unrelated reply — where they superseded the worker's own sign-off (maintainer 2026-10-01: "the
//   questions are taken out of the place where they were sort of embedded in the transcript and all
//   just show up in a bunch at the bottom of the chat"; 2026-10-05: "the pending questions that may or
//   may not be relevant kind of supersede how the agent actually signed off"). Measured over the 867
//   questions asked here since 2026-09-11, 38% outlived a later rest, and 72% of those resumes were
//   wakes, not the human.
//
// The fix for the 2026-08-31 report now lives in the CONTRACT, not here: a question is a sign-off only at
// the rest that asked it, and at every later rest the worker names each one it still needs under
// `questions:` or withdraws it (server scheduler.evalSignoffNudges / evalParkIntegrity). So the newest
// rest never reads as a bare stop with an ask hidden above it, and this file only has to honour what the
// worker said: a card stays where it was asked until a later rest claims it, and a claim moves it to the
// end of that rest — under the fence that named it.
