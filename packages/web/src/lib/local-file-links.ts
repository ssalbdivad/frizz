// Act on a vetted local path, in Frizz whenever Frizz can show it (lib/localViewer.ts): a picture opens

// on /full, a drawer everywhere else). Only a format the page cannot draw — a PDF, a spreadsheet, an
// archive — goes to the server, which realpath-gates it and hands it to the opener the
// `localFileOpener` setting names; every in-app viewer carries that same opener as its "Open". The
// decision lives HERE, in the one place every local-path activation passes through, rather than in
// each producer — markdown links, resolved inline-code paths, attachment chips, the Codex file rows,
// the tool-header path links and the saved links all get the same routing from this single branch.
//
// Components that own their own click (PathLink, whose row swallows the event before it can reach the
// delegated listener below) call this directly; everything that only tags itself `data-local-path`
// arrives through the interceptor, which passes the clicked element as `from` so a picture knows which
// pictures it was shown among. `scope` names the project the link belongs to when that is not the
// page's — a card on the everything page, or a reader opened from one — and every read and open then
// goes through that project's gate, whose roots include its own checkout wherever it lives.
//

// it; the reader is handed the bare path. Absent, it is read off `from` (lib/localFilePosition.ts), which is
// how every DELEGATED reader of `data-local-path` — this module's, the everything page's card scope, the
// reader's own scoped links — carries a line without each one knowing the attributes exist.
