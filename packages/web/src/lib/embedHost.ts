//    — the relay the extension's webview runs — and only in a shape the contract defines.
//  - page → host: `frizz:ready` once the page can act on those, and `frizz:key` for the chords the
//    page left alone. (`frizz:open-file` and `frizz:open-external` leave from the link handlers that
//    decide them, lib/local-file-links.ts and lib/external-links.ts; `frizz:add-context` from the
//    context bar over the sidebar's composers, lib/editorContext.ts.)

// ── focus: the keyboard is the editor's until the human (or the host) hands it over ──────────────────
//
// A frame inside VS Code is not a browser tab. In a tab, a script calling `focus()` while the human is in
// another window moves nothing; in a VS Code webview it takes the keyboard from the EDITOR. Driven in real
// VS Code 1.140 and 1.90 (scripts/e2e-sidebar.ts, 2026-10-01): with a thread open, every selection in the
// editor posted `frizz:editor-context`, the context bar re-rendered inside the drawer, Radix's focus trap
// saw the frame's `activeElement` fall back to <body> (Chromium does that in a frame that has lost focus)
// and called `focus()` on the drawer — and 150-300ms after the selection the webview had the keyboard,
// even with the sidebar hidden. Ctrl+I then never reached the editor, and the next letters typed were the
// page's shortcuts: `d` marked the thread done. 6 runs of 6.
//
// So while the page does not have focus, a programmatic `focus()` is dropped — unless the host just asked
// for the page to take it (a compose with the caret, a title-row command, a navigation), when the relay
// focuses the frame first (packages/vscode/src/sidebar-html.ts) and the page's own focus lands after, and
// only until the human leaves the page again (lib/hostFocusGate.ts, which says why that matters). This
// guards every focus thief, the one found and the ones not written yet. The drawer's trap itself stays on
// in the sidebar, where a thread is modal (ui/Sheet.tsx useNarrowDrawer); a CLOSING drawer lets go of it
// (ThreadSheet.tsx).
//
// And the reverse: a frame that gets focus back (the human clicks the view's edge, VS Code re-focuses the
// view after a title-row button) comes back with nothing focused — Chromium does not restore an iframe's
// focused element the way it restores a window's. So the last element that had focus gets it again, unless
// the human is pressing somewhere in the page, whose click decides.
