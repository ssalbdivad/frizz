 * the prose, never appended to the raw value: a draft's trailing lines may be attachment paths
 * (imagePaths.ts), and those must stay trailing.
 *
 * `note` is prose the editor wants after the reference, as if typed there ("Ask Frizz to fix" sends the
 * problem's message: `@a.ts:12 Fix: Cannot find name 'foo'. ts(2304)`). One space between, one after,
 * and the caret after that, so the human's own words carry straight on. A terminal selection
 * (`isTerminalPath`) drops its lines: they are the terminal buffer's, not a file's.
