// (`lines: null`), which is the state a shell sits in between its tool_use and its launch ack. Keying
// the stop on "did anything report a number" instead stopped the poll during that window and the
// counter never arrived. It stops when every named shell has settled, and when the server knows none
// of them at all: a settled shell's line count cannot move again.
//
// SCOPED TO WHAT IS RENDERED, on purpose: this is the reason the reading is not a board field. An
// operator looking at one thread pays for that thread's shells and nothing else, and closing the view
// unmounts the poll entirely.
