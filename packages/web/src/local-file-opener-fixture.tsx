// Every destination a local-file link can have, on one page. A file Frizz can show opens in Frizz: a
// `.md` or any other text file in its reader (the interceptor pushes a `file` drawer and never calls
// the RPC), a picture in the picture viewer. A format the page cannot draw — the PDF here — is handed
// to the desktop opener through `openLocalFile`. The readouts below are what the e2e test asserts, so
// a regression in ANY direction — a Markdown or JSON link that launches an editor, a screenshot that
// opens a browser tab, a PDF that opens a reader that cannot render it — fails loudly rather than
// looking fine in the markup.
//
// The page also carries the two destinations a worker WRITES rather than spells out: a project-relative
// path and a home-anchored one. Both used to stay relative hrefs, which the browser resolved against
// the thread page — clicking a handoff link navigated to `/thread/<slug>/.frizz/threads/<id>/HANDOFF.md`
// and out of the app. `baseDir`/`homeDir` are what useMarkdownHtml hands the renderer off the board.
