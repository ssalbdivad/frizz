// WHICH PROJECT A SHARED THREAD CONTROL ACTS ON.

// The lifecycle verbs — Snooze, Mark as done — are one component each, drawn on the queue card, the
// thread drawer and the fullscreen page. Each called `rpc`, which addresses whatever project the ADDRESS
// names; in a drawer or on /full that is the thread's own project by construction (a drawer's address is
// `/all/<its slug>/thread/<t>`). The cross-project page's queue draws threads of EVERY project while the
// page is focused on one, where `rpc` means the FOCUSED project — so the same button on a card there
// would snooze the focus's `fix-auth` instead of the one on the card.
//
// A control reads its client from here. Absent a provider it is `rpc`, so the drawer and /full behave
// exactly as before without knowing this exists; the cross-project page wraps each card in a provider
// naming the card's project.
