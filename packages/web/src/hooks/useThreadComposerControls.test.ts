// A hook below that return is then skipped on exactly that render, and React tears down the tree with
// "change in the order of Hooks" — which is how a steered queue card took every other card with it in
// one frame (2026-09-19). The browser pin is components/queueCardStates.e2e.test.ts ("a steered card
// dissolves without taking its neighbour down"); this keeps the shape.
