 * `localFileOpener`, `homeFolder` and the rest of MACHINE_SETTING_KEYS are one value for the machine, and
 * a reader that is still bound to another project's entry has to see the new one too. That reader
 * exists: the project rail's hook lives in the layout, which a project switch on the one page does not
 * re-render, so it stays on the entry it was cold-loaded under (lib/projectRail.ts). Switch All projects'
 * prompt box to another project, flip Project sidebar to On, and the save landed in the new project's
 * entry while the rail read the old one — it did not appear until a reload (2026-09-28).
 * lib/projectRail.e2e.test.ts drives a switch and a flip.
 *
 * Only the machine keys are written across, and nothing is refetched: a refetch runs under the CURRENT
 * page's project, so it would pour this project's own settings into every other project's entry.

//  - WRITES ARE SERIALIZED. Every payload is a WHOLE Settings object, so two overlapping requests that
//    land out of order leave the server holding the older snapshot. Chaining each write onto the
//    previous one's settled promise makes the last thing touched the last thing stored.
//  - A PENDING DEBOUNCE IS FLUSHED ON UNMOUNT. Otherwise the last half-second of typing dies with the
//    surface — precisely the keystrokes the Save button used to capture.
//  - A RETRYABLE FAILURE IS RETRIED. Removing the Save button also removed the operator's way to try
//    again, so the one failure the RPC layer certifies as side-effect-free — `isRetryableRpcError`,
//    which the composer already leans on during a control-plane restart — has to be replayed here.
//    Anything else is AMBIGUOUS (it may have landed) and must be reported, never re-sent.
//

// a write HELD behind that read (`holdFor`) leaves `pending` in place until the read lands, so the
