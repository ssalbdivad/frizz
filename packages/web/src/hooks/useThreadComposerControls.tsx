// One control strip for every place a registered thread can be steered: the model/effort selector, and
// — for a Claude thread — the Auto/Bypass permission picker beside it. This lives outside the component
// module so exporting the hook does not invalidate Vite Fast Refresh for ThreadActionBar.
//
// THE PERMISSION PICKER CAME BACK, NARROWED. Every per-thread permission/sandbox control was removed
// from this strip on 2026-07-23, and the reason was sound for the controls that existed: they offered
// the RESTRICTIVE modes, and a headless worker narrowed to `default` or `acceptEdits` or a codex
// `read-only` just wedges on an approval nobody is watching. What the maintainer asked for on
// 2026-08-13 is the other half of that axis — "for Claude Code specifically, I'm curious if there's a
// way for us to switch between Auto mode and Bypass Permissions mode" — and neither of those two can
// wedge anything: `auto` is what dispatch already launches with, and bypass is strictly more permissive
// still. So the options here are exactly the two Settings offers for a NEW worker
// (CLAUDE_DISPATCH_PERMISSION_OPTIONS), which is also what keeps the launch default and the per-thread
// override speaking one vocabulary.
//
// CODEX IS DELIBERATELY LEFT OUT. Its axis is a sandbox rather than a permission mode, its restrictive
// end is the one that caused the 2026-07-23 removal, and the ask was Claude-specific.
