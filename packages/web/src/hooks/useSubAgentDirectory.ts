// A THREAD'S SUB-AGENT DIRECTORY — every child it ever dispatched, live and returned, with each one's
// `thread.child` address (the `subAgentDirectory` RPC). Read by the `@thread.` typeahead and by a click
// on a `@thread.child` link, through ONE cache key so the menu that offered a child and the link that
// names it later share the answer.
//
// The client is the thread control's own (useThreadApi): the page's project, or the card's on the
// cross-project page — the same project the prompt box's thread candidates come from, since a box on
// another project's card is offered none (useMentionCandidates). The project rides the key so two
// projects' same-slug threads never share a cache entry.
//
// STALE TIME is what keeps typing cheap: `@port-the-parser.c`, `.ca`, `.cac` all read the one answer the
// dot fetched. Ten seconds is long enough to cover a word and short enough that a child dispatched a
// moment ago shows up by the next time the dot is typed.
