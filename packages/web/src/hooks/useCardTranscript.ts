// A QUEUE CARD'S TRANSCRIPT — read through the card's OWN project, under a key that names it.
//
// The card opens on the handoff (AllQueuesCard handoffQuery), which is two messages the server cuts for it
// and the reason a page of every project's queue is cheap to draw. It reads the transcript itself only when
// it needs one: to place its open questions at the rest each was asked at (lib/queueCardQuestions.ts),
// which the handoff cannot say — the rests between the human's turn and the newest one are not in it.
// (Reading back through the thread is the drawer's job, one click away: AllQueuesCard "Show earlier
// messages".)
//
// NOT the drawer's cache entry (`["transcript", slug]`, hooks.ts useTranscript). That one is the PAGE's:
// hashed under the page's project scope, kept live by transcript-live.ts through the page's socket, and read
// through the page's `rpc` — all three name the focused project, which on All projects is usually not the
// card's, and an observer of that key would subscribe the card's slug on the wrong project's socket. This
// key carries its project (`ofProject`, lib/queryKeyScope.ts) and its REST, like the handoff's: a card is a
// thread at rest, so the transcript it shows cannot move until the thread rests again, and a new rest is a
// new key. No socket, no poll, no watchdog — the same economy as the handoff.
