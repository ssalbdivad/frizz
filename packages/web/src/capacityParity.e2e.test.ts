// CAPACITY PARITY — the gate on "the default shows at least as much as upstream's default".
//
// Opt-in, and unlike every other *.e2e.test.ts here it needs NOTHING running: it boots its own three
// disposable Frizz stacks (`scripts/adhoc-stack.mjs`, sandbox HOME, throwaway port), seeds each, renders
// it in its own headless Chrome and tears all of it down, pass or fail. One command runs it end to end:
//   FRIZZ_CAPACITY_E2E=1 nub run test packages/web/src/capacityParity.e2e.test.ts
// Set FRIZZ_CAPACITY_E2E_SHOTS=/abs/dir to also keep a screenshot of every measurement. It is listed in
// scripts/e2e-web.mjs's NEEDS_REAL_STACK (it drives the real app, not a fixture page), so neither
// `nub run test` nor `nub run test:e2e` boots its stacks: three Vite-served servers and six page loads
// took 2.5-3.5 minutes on 2026-10-06, which the unit suite should not pay on every run.
//
// WHY THE BAR EXISTS. Colin's standup (S3) put the scale question as a real machine: 17 projects and
// about 70 open threads. David's first answer (2026-10-06, plans/upstream-superset.md § Capacity parity)
// was that there is no view setting and All projects stays home at `/` — so the DEFAULT had to carry that
// load, and "carries it" is defined against the thing Colin built: the default must show at least as
// much, without scrolling, as upstream's default does. That is a number, so it is pinned as one. Later
// that day a project's BOARD became the default (`/` goes back to the last view, a board for a browser
// that never chose) and All projects moved to `/all`, one click away; both views keep the bar, since
// either can be the one a browser opens.
//
// WITH THE RAIL ON AND OFF. Upstream's project rail came back the same day, opt-in (Settings → Project
// sidebar, `projectRail`). It takes 57px of width on both views, which can wrap a title onto a second
// line and so cost rows, so every measurement is taken twice — the rail off (the default) and on, set
// through settingsSet before the page loads — and both must meet the bar. Each reading says whether the
// rail was actually drawn, so a run that silently measured the same thing twice fails.
//
// WHERE 22 AND 28 COME FROM. Upstream's own board (colinhacks/frizz at 0a3b9139), seeded with every one
// of the 70 open threads in ONE project and rendered by this same visibility rule, shows 22 thread rows
// at 1440x900 and 28 at 1920x1080, its band headers and rules included. The baseline is a measurement
// of that commit, not a design target; re-measure on a newer upstream before moving it.
//
// WHAT IS COUNTED. A row counts only when its WHOLE box lies inside the viewport and inside every
// clipping (overflow != visible) ancestor — fully readable without scrolling, not peeking out under a
// fold. Two views, three loads:
//   - All projects at `/all`, Colin's load (17 projects, 70 open threads skewed across projects and across
//     pinned / queue / running / snoozed, plus three done per project). LINES = thread rows
//     `[data-sidebar-item]` + project header rows `[data-xq-project-row]`: a header is a line of the
//     same height carrying that project's counts, which is information upstream's board, one project
//     at a time, does not show at all. Must be >= 22 / >= 28.
//   - All projects at `/all`, David's load (4 projects, 10 threads). Every loud row — pinned, queue,
//     running — must be fully visible: at a light load nothing that wants the human may sit below a fold.
//   - The project board at `/project/<slug>`, the capacity load (the same 70 in ONE project). ROWS =
//     `[data-sidebar-item]` alone, the like-for-like with upstream's sidebar. Must be >= 22 / >= 28.
// The test reads only that DOM contract (`data-sidebar-item`, `data-xq-project-row`, `data-xq-band`), so
// the views can be restyled freely as long as they still fit the numbers.
//
// SEEDING. Each thread is a `session` row in the stack's sqlite, a transcript JSONL the real tailer
// reads, and — for every open thread — a broker liveness record naming a stand-in `sleep` daemon, the
// recipe of scripts/seed-all-queues.mjs. No RPC creates a thread without a real agent, and a Running
// thread is precisely one whose broker daemon is alive mid-turn, so the row is the fixture and the
// server's real tailer → board → push → render path does the rest. The daemon is this test's to kill.
//
// Measured on David's fork when this landed (2026-10-06, 48ea0568, before All projects was compacted),
// at 1440x900 / 1920x1080: the project board 22 / 29 rows (passes); All projects at Colin's load
// 17 / 22 lines, i.e. 11 rows + 6 headers / 14 rows + 8 headers (FAILS — each project group then cost
// ~60px beyond its rows: a header, a "N more" row and a rule); David's load 8 of 8 loud rows at both.
// The rail-on readings start with the commit that restored the rail (2026-10-06, on us-default).
