// Browser QA + e2e surface for the composer's SKILLS TYPEAHEAD (issue #21): a draft that is exactly
// one `/`-led token opens a menu of the thread's invocable skills above the box. The suggestion
// source is stubbed here — the real ThreadComposerBox wires it to the threadSkills RPC, whose
// server side has its own tests; this fixture proves the Composer half (trigger, filter, keyboard,
// accept, dismiss) against a list shaped like a real harness reply.
//
// `?font=mono` flips the app's font setting — this app renders in two fonts and a fixture that never
// sets `data-font` silently pins the mono default (see AGENTS.md).

// One row per SOURCE the harness can report, plus one with none — the unlabelled row is the case that
// matters, because "show it if we know it" means a harness that stays silent must still render.
