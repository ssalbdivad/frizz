// The page's QUEUE CARD (components/AllQueuesCard.tsx) in the states its own tests used to cover on the
// board's card, before that card and its fixtures were deleted with the board (098de26d, 2026-09-28).
// The REAL AllQueuesCard renders, with the REAL optimistic-exit hook the page runs
// (AllQueues.tsx useLeavingCards: leave → fade → hidden → back after REAPPEAR_MS unless the queue drops
// the thread). Only the network is stubbed, and every RPC the cards make is recorded on window.__rpc.
//
//   ?case=exit (default)       two resting cards; `Mark as done` on the first. completeThread answers
//                              after ?delay= ms (default 1500), then the "poll" drops the thread.
//     &needsConfirmation=1     …the server declines instead (fast, as it really is — the liveness check
//                              runs before any teardown), carrying a hold naming live work.
//     &fail=1                  …the RPC fails.
//     &stalePoll=1             …it succeeds, but the poll does not drop the thread: 9s after the click a
//                              read that STARTED before the done lands (thread still queued), and only
//                              12s after it does a fresh read drop the thread — a loaded server's poll.
//     &stillQueued=1           …it succeeds, and a read started after it still lists the thread: the
//                              done evidently did not take, so the card must come back.
//                              A reply sent from the first card's box steers it: the "poll" drops the
//                              thread 400ms later, once the fade is over.
//     &replyDelay=<ms>         …the reply's followUp answers only after that long (a cold resume, a retry).
//   ?case=registered-done      the thread signed off with `mcp__frizz__done`: no fence in the handoff text,
//                              a registered `lastFence` on the thread (B1).
//   ?case=fenced-and-registered  both: the fence in the text AND the registration — one card, not two.
//   ?case=pending-ask          a session frozen at a native AskUserQuestion, nothing journaled (B2).
//   ?case=perm-prompt          a session parked on a permission prompt, nothing journaled (B2).
//   ?case=perm-prompt-journaled  the same, but an answerable interaction IS journaled: the net stands down.
//   ?case=replied              a park queued only for its unread reply (queuedForReply): "Replied", and
//                              Mark as read records it seen (threadSeen), after which the poll drops it.
//   ?case=steps                the first card's thread is AT REST on an ```awaiting fence handing the human
//                              `steps:` (upstream fe668a8d): the card draws the drawer's steps card, and its
//                              Done replies into the CARD's project and takes the card out. The neighbour is
//                              an ordinary rest.
//   ?case=resting              the first card's thread rests on an agent terminal it declared (`shells:`), so
//                              it draws the RESTING card — the wait row and the event-snooze, which parks it
//                              through the card's project and takes the card out.
//   ?case=questions            each card's question at the rest that asked it (upstream e157817a, 22084580). The
//                              first card's was asked two rests ago, the rest after it is a CI wake's bare
//                              reply: the question sits under the reply that asked it, and the bare rest
//                              draws "Rested without a sign-off". The second card's question is its newest
//                              rest's own: under the handoff, no rested card. Both read their transcript
//                              through the card's project (threadTranscript).
//   ?case=long                 the first card's thread ran 22 rounds against the human's last message, after
//                              four earlier ones: "Show earlier messages" opens its transcript IN the card,
//                              one round back, with the middle rounds folded behind "N more rounds"; "Load
//                              earlier messages" pages back one turn per press (threadTranscriptEarlier),
//                              and the header's collapse folds the card to its header.
//   ?case=facts                a card whose header facts line carries a context reading (narrow-width check).
//     &chip=1                  …led by its project, as on a page showing All projects.
//   ?case=facts-matrix         one card per combination of facts in facts-fixture-cases.ts (a context reading,
//                              a goal loop, a worktree, a spinoff, a long status line), for judging the line's
//                              drop-whole rule at every width at once. Takes &chip=1 too.
//   &cardw=<px>                the queue column's width (default 640px, capped at the viewport).
//   ?case=many&n=<count>       a long queue (default 60 cards), every third handoff long enough to clamp, on
//                              a page whose board IS the cards' project (so the `@` typeahead has threads to
//                              offer). Each card sits in a <Profiler> counting its commits on
//                              window.__renders, and window.__boardDelta() moves the board the way a live
//                              delta does — queueCardVisibility.e2e.test.ts. `&mid=1` gives the short cards
//                              a ~300-character handoff instead, which rewraps (changes height) when the
//                              column's width changes; `&handoffDelay=<ms>` answers every handoff that late.
//                              window.__filter(pattern) shows only the cards whose id matches, as a project
//                              filter does (the rest unmount), and __filter(null) shows them all again.
//
// The card's project is NOT the page's: `store.board` names another project, so a control that read the
// page's client instead of the card's would call `/_frizz/rpc/…` (unprefixed) and show up in __rpc as
// such. The terminal net's copy must call `/_frizz/<card project>/rpc/threadTerminalCommand`.
