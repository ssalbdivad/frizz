// THE ROUTE TREE — and, more to the point, the LAYOUT that outlives a navigation.
//
// The rail is chrome: it draws every project on the machine and is identical on every page, so it
// must not be torn down and rebuilt when you use it. Before this it was mounted twice — once inside
// <App/> and once inside <ProjectGrid/> — because `main.tsx` chose ONE of three root shells from
// `location.pathname` at module load, which made every project switch a full document load. A layout
// route is the direct expression of "this part does not change": <RootLayout/> holds the rail and the
// tooltip provider, and the <Outlet/> below it swaps between the cross-project page and a board.
//
// WHAT A PROJECT SWITCH ACTUALLY COSTS, and why the router alone was never the whole job. Four things
// are bound to one project, and only the first two are this hook's business:
//   · the live feed — one socket per project (api/socket.ts rebindProject)
//   · the board store, the drawer stack and the current view (store.resetProjectState)
//   · the react-query cache, which now needs NOTHING here. It used to be swept on every switch,
//     exempting the project list so the rail would not blank mid-navigation; the cache is scoped by
//     project at the hash instead (lib/queryKeyScope.ts), so one project's entries are invisible to
//     another rather than deleted in front of it. Switching back finds a warm cache, and a response
//     that arrives late has nowhere wrong to land.
//   · the API base, which needs nothing: base-path.ts derives it from the page's path on every call,
//     and the router keeps `location` synchronous with navigation.
//
// The board is KEYED by slug so it genuinely remounts per project — its state is per-project and
// reusing the instance across a switch would carry the previous board's mounted surfaces into the new
// one. The rail above it is not keyed, so it persists. That contrast is the whole design.

 * thread drawer open it is `/all/<slug>/thread/<t>` — the thread's own address, focused on its project.

 * machine-wide data and name their project on every call, as they always have (AllQueues.tsx).

 * across a drawer opening or closing — the page must not remount under the operator. `<App/>` is keyed

 * board and drawer stack) is reset by the binding instead.
