// THE ROUTE TREE — and, more to the point, the LAYOUT that outlives a navigation.
//
// The layout's hosts (the project rail, tooltips, toasts, the add-project dialog, hovercards, keys) must
// not be torn down and rebuilt on a navigation. `main.tsx` once chose ONE of three root shells from `location.pathname`
// at module load, which made every project switch a full document load. A layout route is the direct
// expression of "this part does not change": <RootLayout/> holds them, and the <Outlet/> below it holds
// the one page — a project's board or All projects — or a redirect into it.
//
// WHAT A PROJECT SWITCH ACTUALLY COSTS, and why the router alone was never the whole job. Four things
// are bound to one project, and only the first two are this hook's business:
//   · the live feed — one socket per project (api/socket.ts rebindProject)
//   · the board store, the drawer stack and the current view (store.resetProjectState)
//   · the react-query cache, which now needs NOTHING here. It used to be swept on every switch,
//     exempting the project list so it would not blank mid-navigation; the cache is scoped by
//     project at the hash instead (lib/queryKeyScope.ts), so one project's entries are invisible to
//     another rather than deleted in front of it. Switching back finds a warm cache, and a response
//     that arrives late has nowhere wrong to land.
//   · the API base, which needs nothing: base-path.ts derives it from the page's path on every call,
//     and the router keeps `location` synchronous with navigation.
//
// A project switch on the page never remounts it: the page is keyed by a constant (CrossProjectPage), and
// what is per-project — the store's board and drawer stack — is reset by the binding instead.

/**
 * Re-bind everything that belongs to one project, whenever the project changes — and say whether the
 * tree below may render yet.
 *
 * THE CONDITION IS ASKED OF THE FEED, and that is the whole point. This hook used to keep its own note
 * of the project it had bound, in a `useRef` — a second copy of a fact it did not own. Every switch
 * that changes which ROUTE matched (the home page to a board, a board to a thread page) unmounts one element
 * and mounts another, so the ref was born fresh, initialised to the slug it was looking at, and
 * therefore always answered "already bound". The feed stayed on the previous project while the URL, the
 * `<App/>` key and the board header all said the new one, and nothing short of a document load recovered
 * it (2026-08-11: every board on the machine rendered the launching project's threads).
 *
 * `feedIsBoundTo` asks the module that HOLDS the connection. It has nothing to remember and therefore
 * nothing to get wrong on a remount, and being called redundantly is free.
 *
 * THE RETURN VALUE IS A GATE, and the caller renders nothing project-scoped until it is true. The reset
 * cannot happen before the first render under the new URL — it is a side effect, and a render must not
 * have one — so for one commit the store still holds the project you left: its board, its drawer stack,
 * its composer drafts. Rendering the remounted `<App/>` in that commit was the bug: every per-thread
 * hook in it ran against the NEW project's API with the OLD project's slugs. Most were wasted reads
 * (`threadTranscript`, `threadSettledQuestions`); one was a 500 (`threadProfileOptions`, which #50 gated
 * on its own until this made that redundant); and one was a WRITE — a thread drawer left open across
 * the switch sent `threadSeen` for its slug to the new project, marking that project's same-slug thread
 * read when nobody had opened it (2026-10-08). Gating each hook covers the hooks someone has noticed;
 * gating the tree covers the class.
 *
 * Two conditions open it:
 *   · BOUND — the feed is on this project, or this hook has just reset and rebound for this slug.
 *     `settled` is the second half rather than a second `feedIsBoundTo` read because the feed records
 *     the project from the PATH while `slug` comes from the route's params: a catch-all match can make
 *     the two disagree for good, and a gate waiting on that would be a blank page forever.
 *   · OWNED — the board in the store is stamped with this page's project (lib/projectOwnership.ts), on
 *     the payload's own evidence. Once bound this holds by construction (the reset nulled the board, and
 *     setBoard / seedBoard refuse a foreign one), so on a correct path it never closes the gate. It is
 *     here because the binding is bookkeeping, and bookkeeping is what has failed before; a closed gate
 *     re-runs the reset rather than waiting, so a bookkeeping miss costs a reconnect, not a blank page.
 *
 * The reset is a LAYOUT effect so the gated commit and the one that reopens it land in the same task.
 * Frame-sampled across a rail switch (2026-10-08, headless): the ordinary effect painted the old board
 * under the new URL for 2–3 frames, then an empty board area for 2; the gate paints no stale frame and 1
 * empty one.
