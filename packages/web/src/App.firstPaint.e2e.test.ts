// THE FIRST FRAME IS THE FINAL LAYOUT, on a reload in a browser that has seen this machine before.
// Two things the page is built from arrive AFTER React's first render — the font and the project rail,
// both in `settingsGet` — and each used to be guessed at first and corrected a round trip later, moving
// everything on screen: the type family flipped mono → sans (a document-wide reflow), and the rail
// appeared and pushed the page 57px right (maintainer 2026-08-25: "This is layout shift"). The rail keeps
// its last answer in localStorage and uses it for the first frame; the font stopped being a setting on
// 2026-09-19 and is pinned sans on <html>. A requestAnimationFrame sampler installed before any script
// runs records every change to the two and to where the queue column (`#workpane`) sits, so the
// assertion is over the whole load rather than a screenshot of one moment. (The rail was removed on
// 2026-09-30 and this check with it; both came back with upstream's rail on 2026-10-06. It loads All
// projects, `/all`; the rail shows on a board the same way.)
//
// Until 2026-09-28 there was a third: whether the project's BOARD had a sidebar, from its first push,
// mirrored the same way — it pushed the workpane 269px right when it mounted late. The board went with
// the project view, and the one page's list column is always there, so there is nothing left to mirror.
//
// The CONTROL clears the mirrors: the same sampler must then SEE the rail arrive late and the
// workpane move, or the assertions above were passing on a sampler that could not observe a shift.
