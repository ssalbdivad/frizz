// EVERY WAKE FRIZZ DELIVERS, in one transcript, so the family can be judged as a family — which is the
// only way the defect this page was built for is visible at all. Review activity had rendered as a
// hairline since the notification card died; a PR reaching a terminal state, CI reaching a verdict, and a
// background shell finishing behind a resting worker had not, and arrived as full-width bordered cards
// stacked under those hairlines (maintainer 2026-08-18: "these callouts should obviously be hairlines",
// and 2026-08-19 on extending it to the rest).
//
// Recognized wakes use the scheduler's real formatters. Fallback samples also cover text with no
// structured parser, including the Markdown envelope around a batch of held wakes.
//
// `?font=sans|mono` sets `data-font`. The prose font is a user setting applied before first paint, and a
// fixture that does not set it silently renders the mono default — which is how a glyph fitted here once
// rode visibly high in the maintainer's sans window.

// No `wakeSteer` is served on any of these. That is the real wire state for a status wake (the server's
// steer parser reads line 0, so a status line above one means no served field) and it exercises the
// client's own fallback parse, which is the only parser the combined case has.
// Every wake carries a DELIVERY instant, spread down the page so the ages on the tails read as a
// sequence (`3h ago` … `2m ago`) rather than one repeated value — the real transcript's shape, and the
// only way to see that the family's ages line up with one another and with the two that keep an instant
// of their own (a review item dates by GitHub's clock, a timer by its own fire time).
