// Browser QA for the FOLD of a ```question fence into the registered question it restates
// (lib/questionShadow): the thread page, with the transcript shape of the 2026-08-28 report — the worker
// fenced a release go/no-go, a watcher's wake buried it, it registered the question with `ask`, then
// re-fenced it at sign-off. One card must render at the tail: the registered one, with its ×.
//
//   (default)      — the final fence RESTATES the registration ⇒ one card, and one Send answers.
//   ?different=1   — the final fence asks ANOTHER question ⇒ two cards, each answerable: the fold
//                    never hides a question the human has not seen elsewhere.
//   ?virtualized=1 — the thread page's virtualized transcript path. Same expectations. (A `?view=`
//                    switch chose the board's queue card until that card was deleted, 2026-09-28.)
//   ?font=sans     — the other of the two fonts this app renders in.
