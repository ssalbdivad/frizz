// 2026-09-29 on the real board with the tab idle: 177 entries/s, so a dev tab left open overnight held
// ~10M of them, and the GC pressure surfaced as multi-second freezes while typing. Nothing in the app
// reads the buffer, and DevTools records these tracks from trace events at call time, so emptying it
// loses no profiling data. Production React emits none of this.
