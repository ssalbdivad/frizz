// Browser QA for the QUEUED TAIL. Three things live here:
//  · SPACING — successive queued (optimistic) user bubbles must carry the same STEP rhythm as any other
//    pair of messages.
//  · THE PUSH-NOW CONTROL — the ↑ that appears left of a queued bubble on hover and preempts the turn
//    standing in front of the queue. It needs exactly what this fixture already sets up: `runtime:
//    "running"` on a claude thread plus queued bubbles. `deliveryId`s are set so the bubbles are also
//    UNQUEUEABLE, which is the real-app shape and the only way to see that the hover lift still fires
//    from the group rather than the bubble.
//  · THE HOVER READING under a queued bubble (`MessageStamp`, host `bubble`). Every message carries an
//    `at` for it — without one the reading renders nothing, which is why this fixture watched the queued
//    row for a month and never saw its reading land ON the bubble's bottom edge (2026-08-31). The row
//    is built by ChatView's own QUEUED branch, so what is photographed here is the shipped call site,
//    not a rebuilt copy of it.
// The drawer (ThreadView/ChatView) is the one surface that renders the queued tail. The board's queue
// card built its own copy of the pinned queued group and was mounted here too, as the default, until it
// was deleted with the single-project board (2026-09-28); `?surface=drawer` is still accepted, and is now
// what every load renders.
