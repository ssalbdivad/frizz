// Browser QA for the QUIET META COLUMN — the `Ran N tool calls` digest, a collapsed reasoning row and
// the live shimmer, stacked (maintainer 2026-08-01: "All of these labels are way too close together.
// Specifically, the ran 8 tool calls, the thought, and then the active shimmer").
//
// The transcript below is the REAL one from that screenshot, session 1dbbe276 records 1..51, replayed
// shape-for-shape minus the thinking rows the transcript no longer carries: an opening prose message, a
// run of 8 calls, a QUEUED steer, and a live two-call tail whose newest member supplies the shimmer's
// gerund.
//
// The queued bubble is the whole point. It renders at the BOTTOM of the pane (never inline), yet it used
// to end the activity run in coalesceToolActivityMessages — which stranded the run above as a settled
// digest for no cause the reader could see.
//
// Three controls:
//   ?steer=landed — the same column with the steer DELIVERED. Breaking the run is correct there, so the
//                   calls above it settle into their own digest.
//   ?state=settled — the turn is over, so nothing is withheld: the whole run returns as one digest.
//   ?stack=three   — THREE bare labels in a row, which is the arrangement the report was actually about.
//                   It survives the queued-steer fix because a Codex `reasoning` row is deliberately NOT
//                   folded into a run (it carries real content and is already its own disclosure), so it
//                   splits one: digest → reasoning label → the live tail's shimmer. Codex thinks before
//                   nearly every call, so this is the COMMON shape, not an edge case — it is the one to
//                   judge the label rhythm on.
