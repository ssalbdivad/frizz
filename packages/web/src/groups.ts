// the parent's indicator speaks for the parent. A queued row therefore sits in the rested band AND

//
// SINCE 2026-07-30 the live-SUB-AGENT case no longer reaches here at all: the server now excuses such a
// thread from the queue entirely (board.deriveNeedsYou), so `needsYou` is false and the row keeps its
// spinner in the running band — which is the point, since a row that never leaves that band never
// churns between the two. The maintainer's ellipsis rule was scoped to a row that "shows up in the
// queue", and one that no longer does has no reason to change appearance on resting.
//
// Still load-bearing for the EXITED parent whose children keep reading "running" until their transcript
// goes stale. Without this it would resolve to "working" and hide the [!] stall mark behind a spinner
// for a pane that is already dead. (The other case it used to cover — a shell-only rest, which queues
// again since 2026-08-04 — now has its own mark; see restingOnBackgroundWork, which is checked first

// thing it still has out is something it launched or parked on — a background shell/Monitor, or (since
// 2026-08-13) a PR watcher. That earns its own mark — the pulsing blue dot in the rail's rounded box
// (maintainer 2026-08-01: "if a thread has rested but it still has background work going, like
// background shells, we should keep it in the actively running rail, but we should stop the spinner and
// put a pulsing blue dot in the middle of the rounded circle shape").
//
// The MARK outlived the band. Since 2026-08-04 such a thread carries a queue card again (maintainer:
// "if a thread has rested and the only thing remaining is background shells, we should put it into the
// queue"), so `needsYou` drops its row below the rule into the rested band — and the dot stays, because
// it is the one thing that tells that row apart from an ordinary bare rest at a glance. Snoozing the
// card parks it in the dimmed Snoozed band (isSnoozed reads `bgSnoozed`). Until 2026-08-28 the snooze
// sent it back to the running band with the same dot — "still alive, no longer asking" — and the
// maintainer read that as a row the snooze had not touched at all.
//
// A LIVE SUB-AGENT IS DELIBERATELY EXCLUDED (maintainer, same day: "this should not show up if there
// are sub-agents"), and the two are genuinely different states rather than two flavours of one. A
// dispatched child is work the parent is WAITING ON: its return re-invokes the parent within seconds,
// so the thread is mid-flight in substance even though its own turn ended, and the spinner tells the
// truth. A background shell is DETACHED — the worker launched it and moved on, and 26% of real launches
// are servers that never exit — so nothing about that thread is in motion. Hence: spinner while
// something will come back to you, dot while something merely runs on. A thread with BOTH keeps the
// spinner, because the sub-agent is the stronger fact.
//
// Gated on `turn-idle`, never `exited`: a dead pane cannot be waiting on anything, and that parent must
// keep its [!] stall mark rather than advertise live work behind a dot. `awaitingBackground` is server
// truth — see hasLiveOps for why a raw `bgShells` read would be wrong. (It once ALSO excluded every
// fenced thread, which is no longer so: a parked PR watch, a declared background park and an armed timer
// each set it on an ```awaiting fence. Nothing here depended on that; hasLiveOps did.)
//
// This is only HALF the dot's gate: whether any of that work is still MOVING is the next question, and

// branch needs it — a thread at rest behind its own declared work must never spin, moving or not.

// has: a wait whose subject has ALREADY FINISHED. A green PR is not background work in flight — it is a

// (maintainer 2026-08-19, on an ```awaiting fence naming a PR — `pr:` in the grammar of that day, `prs:`
// since 2026-08-24 — whose card read "10 successful · no
// conflicts": "this task should not be listed as in the actively running rail if it's only awaiting a PR
// with green CI").
//
// So the dot needs motion, and this is the SAME rule the band already draws server-side — CI still
// running holds the thread out of the queue (board.heldByRunningChecks, maintainer 2026-08-14: "only if
// CI has failed or completed successfully should it show up back in the queue"). The mark simply never
// got it, so the two disagreed about one thread: banded as a handoff, marked as live work.

// at all, closed, or never polled — is not motion, and falls through to the at-rest ellipsis.
//
// Reading raw `bgShells` here is safe where hasLiveOps could not: this is already gated on the server's
