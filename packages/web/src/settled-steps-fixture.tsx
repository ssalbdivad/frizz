// Browser QA for A STEPS CARD THAT OUTLIVES ITS REST (2026-10-08, maintainer: "We need to continue showing
// the to do instructions even after they are complete & the thread has moved on"). The drawer, mounted as
// production mounts it (ThreadView, virtualized), over a transcript whose ```awaiting fence handed the
// human steps — and then, per `?at=`, where the thread has got to since:
//
//   ?at=rest     the thread is still resting on the steps — the tail's resting card states them, with Done
//   ?at=running  the human pressed Done and the worker is mid-turn (the default)
//   ?at=moved    the worker finished and rested again on a later fence of its own
//
// The transcript also carries an EARLIER settled fence with no steps — a plain shell wait — which must
// keep drawing nothing in every state: that is the negative control for the exception.
