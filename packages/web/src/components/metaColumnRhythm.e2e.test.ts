// Two invariants, both from the same report (maintainer 2026-08-01, on a column reading `Ran 8 tool
// calls` / `Thought for 33s` / the shimmer: "All of these labels are way too close together"):
//
//   1. A QUEUED steer is invisible inline — it is pinned to the bottom of the pane — so it must not end
//      the activity run it happens to sit inside. It used to, which stranded the calls above it as a
//      settled digest for no cause the reader could see.
//   2. Two bare single-line LABEL rows sit at the ordinary STEP. The 6px tight run needs a bordered
//      CARD on at least one side of the seam — two borders that close together still read as two
//      blocks, whereas two bare grey lines that close together read as one wrapped paragraph.
//      Measured in the browser because it is layout.
