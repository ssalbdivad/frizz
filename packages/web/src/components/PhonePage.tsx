// THE PHONE'S PAGE — a header, three text tabs, ONE list, and a "New thread" button. A fourth tab,
// Schedules, joins the three while the view has any (plans/scheduled-threads.md §8): the desktop's project
// row lists them as its fourth quiet count, and here they are the list's fourth band. There is no schedule
// mode in the phone's prompt box — a schedule is made on the desktop, or proposed by a worker — so the
// phone reads, runs, pauses, turns on and deletes them (PhoneScheduleSheet.tsx).
//
// Upstream's phone board (colinhacks/frizz MobileBoard.tsx, its 2026-09-30 redesign: 6754e72a "the phone
// board gets a header, text tabs and one line per row", 39db08a6 "the projects page is a plain list on a
// phone") brought onto the fork's ONE page (AllQueues.tsx). Below the phone breakpoint (lib/mobile.ts,
// 700px) the page renders this instead of its desktop stack, which on a phone was the prompt box, then
// every Ready card at full height, then the list ~9,400px down with six cards (2026-09-30).
//
// It is not a narrower desktop page. The desktop's two columns and its drawers beside them assume a
// viewport that can hold more than one thing at once; 390pt cannot, so the phone gets a drill-down: the
// projects, a view's list of threads, and a thread (its drawer, which a phone draws full-screen —
// styles.css `.frizz-sheet-panel`).
//
// WHAT IS THE SAME, deliberately: the data. The page hands this its projects exactly as the desktop list
// and queue draw them (lib/allQueues.ts), the tabs band them with the list's own `loudBands`
// (lib/phonePage.ts), and every row reading comes from the rail's helpers — `sessionIndicatorKind` for
// the mark, the queue clock for the age. The VIEW is the page's too: focused on one project
// (`/?project=<slug>`) or All projects (`/`), switched by navigating, so Back works and a reload keeps it.
//
// WHAT IS UPSTREAM'S, each the maintainer's call from its mockup reviews (2026-08-17, 2026-09-30):
//
//   · READY AND WORKING ARE ONE TAB, called QUEUE, asks first ("something is active until it's marked
//     done"); Snoozed and Done are the other two. UNDERLINE TABS UNDER THE HEADER, not a bottom tab bar:
//     the bottom edge belongs to the thumb's primary verb.
//   · A RUNNING ROW WEARS A STATIC PLAY MARK, not the rail's travelling spinner, and NOTHING IN THE CHROME
//     ANIMATES: permanent motion in the corner of the eye is noise.
//   · NO COMPOSER ON THIS SCREEN. Starting a thread is the "New thread" button; a reply box belongs to a
//     thread. AN ASK IS MARKED BY THE ACCENT "?" AND NOTHING ELSE.
//   · ONE SECOND LINE PER ROW says what the thread wants (lib/mobileBoardRow.ts); a live sub-agent count
//     ("· 2 agents") stands in for the child rows. THE SNOOZED TAB'S RIGHT COLUMN SAYS WHEN IT WAKES.
//   · THE HEADER'S ← LEADS TO THE PROJECTS, a plain list, and its gear to Settings.
//
// WHAT IS THE FORK'S: All projects. Its rows come from every project, so each one names its project at
// the head of its second line, and the projects list leads with All projects as the one view that is not a
// project. Its New thread starts in the prompt box's PICK, with the pick's own picker in the box.
//
// NOT PORTED: swipe-to-triage. Its two RPCs were the page project's; on a page whose rows belong to any
// project they would have to go through each project's own client, with the card's optimistic exit, and
// a thread's drawer already has Snooze and Mark as done one tap away.
