// THE QUOTA CHIPS — the readouts at the left of the StatusRow above the prompt box, one compact chip
// per backend showing REMAINING subscription quota. Click a chip for the full per-window breakdown.
//
// A chip renders ONLY when it has a percentage to show (see hasReading). It used to be the provider
// AUTH surface too — a signed-out account drew an em dash whose popover offered Sign in — and that is
// gone with the dash: the sign-in door is the composer's dispatch gate (submitting a thread on a
// signed-out backend opens the same modal) and the `/login` alias.
//
// These are back above the sidebar's dispatch box, where they briefly floated on their own before a
// spell in a fixed corner bar. Quota is ACCOUNT-global — it was never a property of the composer it
// sits over — which is why it rides a GLOBAL status row rather than being composer decoration.
// The chips carry no wrapper padding or justification of their own: StatusRow owns the layout, and a
// chip that brought its own box would break the single-line rhythm.
//
// The live connection state is NOT repeated here: it is the dot at the far right of the same row,
// pinned to the project name.
//
// Quota is polled (rpc.quota) rather than pushed on the board: it is ACCOUNT-global, not per-thread.
// The server keeps the reading warm on its own heartbeat (refreshClaudeQuotaInBackground), so
// this poll just reads that warm cache — a cheap local RPC, no provider round-trip — and a 30s cadence
// keeps the chip tracking the cache within half a minute instead of drifting minutes stale during a
// fast burn. An UNAVAILABLE read re-polls at 15s (a blip should self-heal in seconds), and opening a
// chip's popover forces a fresh read of both quota and auth — the popover is the recheck.

// Every quota/auth request carries an abort deadline. Without one, a single response the server never
// finishes (a dev-server restart severing an in-flight request) leaves the fetch pending FOREVER:
// react-query stays "fetching" and never retries, the recheck latch never clears, and the chip freezes
// into an em dash with a dead click target — the exact reported failure. The deadline turns that into
// an ordinary error the next poll recovers from, while `data` keeps the last good reading.

// THE READING IS SMALL ON PURPOSE (maintainer 2026-08-19: "I wish we'd make the percentages a lot
// smaller. The actual text of the percentage numbers should be small"). 9px, down from 11px, against
// the row's 12px identity — the smallest type anywhere in this app, deliberately. The chips are
// ambient background information, not something to read on every glance, and at 11px two of them
// carried nearly the same weight as the project name they sit opposite. It stops at 9 because tabular
// digits below that stop being legible at a glance, which would trade one problem for another.
//
// It applies to the WRAPPER, so every branch inherits it: the percentage, the em dash a signed-out or
// unavailable provider shows, and the "··" first-fetch placeholder. Those three occupy the same slot
// and a size that only reached one of them would make the chip resize as its state changed.
//
// The PROVIDER MARKS do not shrink with it. They are fixed px in PROVIDER_MARK_GEOMETRY (11px Claude,
// 10px Codex — optically matched to each other, not to any font size), so the mark stays put and only
// the number drops. That is the intended reading: the mark identifies the provider, the small number
// is its current level.

// THE PROVIDER MARK IS AN ICON IN THIS ROW, and carries an icon's size and weight (maintainer
// 2026-08-19: "logos should be the same brightness and size as the other icons. The text should just
// be small"). `text-fg/75` is exactly STATUS_ROW_ACTION's tone, so the two marks sit at the same
// brightness as the home, settings and reload glyphs beside them rather than reading as dimmer
// metadata.
//
// SIZE IS OPTICAL, NOT NOMINAL — and it is two numbers, not one, because these two marks do not fill
// their viewBoxes alike. PROVIDER_MARK_GEOMETRY's 11px/10px pairing already encodes that (the OpenAI
// knot is denser than the Claude asterisk), and the job here is to keep that relationship while
// landing both on the ~12px of ink a 14px lucide glyph paints. Measured with scripts/ink-gaps.mjs at
// --dsf=4 --pad=0 against the settings gear, and re-measure rather than re-guess if either changes.
//
// `!` on both because ProviderMark composes its own `text-muted-65` and `size-*` ahead of this
// className, and Tailwind resolves a same-property collision by CSS SOURCE order, not class order —
// without it these silently lose to the defaults.
