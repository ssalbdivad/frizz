// The activity-row grammar, without a liveness marker or a trailing open icon — and the SAME grammar,
// column for column: a File/Link row renders under the ⤷ AGENT / ⤷ SHELL rows and the eye runs down one
// label column, so it takes their box, their 9px mark slot and their tag column rather than its own.
// THE ROW'S BOX IS THE CHILD-OP ROW'S BOX: no vertical padding and the inherited line-height, so a
// File/Link row measures exactly what the ⤷ AGENT / ⤷ SHELL rows above it measure (17.25px on the
// strip's 2px gap). It shipped with `py-0.5 leading-5`, which made each of these rows 25px against
// 17.25px and the column visibly looser than the live rows it continues (maintainer 2026-09-11:
// "It should be the exact same spacing and padding"). `items-baseline` stays: the icon's
// `self-baseline` cap-band correction below has nothing to align to on an `items-center` row.
// THE LABEL STARTS WHERE EVERY OTHER LABEL STARTS: the slot and the tag come from lib/childOps.ts, and
// the tag's width is the shared per-font track in styles.css (`.frizz-kind-tag`). This row used to
// give itself a 1em slot, a 9px tag and a 33px tag column, which put its label 14.1px right of a SHELL
// row's in mono and 7.2px in sans (maintainer, same day: "The label is further to the right. Why?
// There's no reason for that at all"). Ink gaps after, scripts/ink-gaps.mjs at dsf 6, mono: arrow→icon
// 6.10px and icon→tag 6.25px against a SHELL row's 5.02 / 5.83 (inside the instrument's ±1px floor — the
// dot's halo pulses); tag→label 12.21px against 8.04, the one gap the shared column widens, because
// `File` is four letters in a five-letter track. Label x: 61.89px in every row in mono, 73.44px in sans.

// The SLOT is the baseline-aligned item, not the icon: an svg has no baseline of its own, so the slot's
// is synthesized from the svg's bottom edge, and that edge lands on the label's baseline. `-mt-[1em]`
// collapses the slot's OUTER box onto that edge — a baseline-aligned flex item counts its whole outer
// box above the baseline, and the mono label's ascent (≈11.2px at 11.5px) is shorter than the 1em icon,
// so without the trim the icon set the row 0.5px taller than an AGENT row and pushed the label 0.5px
// down with it (sans, whose ascent is 13px, never showed it). Nothing painted moves; only what the
// row's height arithmetic sees does.
