// THE GOAL MARK — `target-arrow` from Tabler Icons 3.46.0 (MIT, https://tabler.io/icons/icon/target-arrow),
// inlined rather than pulled in as a dependency: it is one glyph out of a 5,900-icon package, and this
// file is the only caller. Tabler draws on the SAME grid as lucide — 24 viewBox, 2px stroke, round caps
// and joins — so it sits in the footer strip as one of the family rather than as a foreign mark.
//
// It replaces lucide's `Target`, which the maintainer read as not-a-target at all (2026-08-13: "Targets
// are supposed to have a filled circle in the middle. Maybe you should find a different icon that has an
// arrow sticking out of it"). They are right about the geometry: lucide's `Target` is three CONCENTRIC
// OUTLINES whose innermost ring is a 2-unit circle drawn with a 2-unit stroke — so at 12px the mark
// collapses into an even weave of rings with a HOLE where the bullseye should be. Tabler's centre is a
// 1-unit circle under the same 2-unit stroke, which paints SOLID at any size, and the dart arrives
// through a gap in both arcs so it reads as having hit the mark rather than sitting beside it.
//
// A HAND-DRAWN VERSION SHIPPED HERE FIRST, for a few hours on 2026-08-13, and the maintainer's reply is
// the note worth keeping: "Are you just generating these icons yourself? This does not look like a good
// icon for a target." It was — one ring, an oversized dot and a bare corner for an arrowhead — and beside
// this one it reads as a record button with a stick through it. Reach for a real icon set (Tabler,
// Phosphor, Remix and Bootstrap were all compared here at 12px) before drawing anything.

// THE GOAL PANEL: one glyph in the thread footer holding what this thread is TRYING TO ACHIEVE, which
// frizz re-sends so the operator does not have to type it again.
//
// It was called "the recurring prompt" until 2026-08-11, which named the MECHANISM rather than the
// content and left the panel describing itself by how it is delivered. What an operator writes here is
// the goal; the switches below it are only WHEN it arrives.
//
// ONE piece of text, and up to three independent reasons to send it:
//
//   STOP HOOK  (scheduler SOURCE 5) — every time the thread comes to REST. No clock, nothing to tune:
//     if it stopped, it is prompted. This is the one that drives an effort forward.
//   HEARTBEAT  (scheduler SOURCE 4) — every N minutes, consulting nothing about what the thread is
//     doing, and DELIVERED MID-TURN. This is the one that reaches a thread that never stops.
//
// NEITHER MECHANISM ON IS THE OFF STATE, and that is why this panel has no third master switch. It used to
// be two separate features with two prompts and two enable toggles; the argument for keeping them apart
// rested on a delivery rule that no longer holds (while a beat waited for rest, a schedule could only
// ever fire AT a rest, where the rest trigger had already fired — same words, same instant). Once
// mid-turn delivery pulled them apart, "nudge this whenever it stops, and at least every N minutes even
// if it doesn't" became one intent costing two prompts to express. Maintainer 2026-08-03, on the master
// switch: "we can delete the top-level toggle since you can now achieve that by just disabling both of
// the other two toggles."
//
// The trigger renders ALWAYS, muted when nothing is armed — a control that only appears once its own
// feature is on cannot be used to turn the feature on. That makes it the one permanent child of the
// footer's left cluster, where everything else is a reading that hides itself when it has nothing to say.

              than imported), and the ONLY surface that says this exists (the rail deliberately carries
              no mark — see groups.ts).

              The mark has now been five things, and each replacement fixed a real misreading. It was a
              square-in-a-circle (`CircleStop`), which in a strip whose other children are live verbs
              read as a stop button — "it seems like clicking it would cause the entire session to stop"
              (maintainer 2026-08-03). It became a `HeartPulse`, which said the true opposite thing:
              something is keeping this thread beating.

              The heartbeat stopped being true on 2026-08-11, when the panel was renamed GOAL. A
              heartbeat names ONE of the three triggers — and not the important one. What the panel
              holds is the thing the thread is trying to achieve, re-sent on whichever triggers the
              operator picked, so the mark is the goal rather than the delivery mechanism. That put
              lucide's `Target` here — and it did not read as one, because its centre is a HOLE where a
              bullseye should be (maintainer 2026-08-13).

              GREY by default and coloured only while something is actually armed: the footer's left
              cluster is a status strip first, so a control with nothing to report has to read as quiet
              as the empty slot it would otherwise leave. Amber, not the app's accent yellow, so it
              reads as a state rather than the focus motif.

              QUIET, NOT DIMMER THAN ITS NEIGHBOURS. This was `text-muted-45` against the meter's and
              the hourglass's `text-muted-60`, and the left cluster consequently read as three marks
              from three different families (maintainer 2026-08-04: "the icon brightnesses and spacing
              look absolutely terrible"). The cluster is one status group, so it takes one tone — the
              armed/idle distinction is carried by the amber, which is the state worth seeing, and not
              by holding the resting glyph a step below the readouts beside it.

              THE GLYPH BRIGHTENS ON THE BUTTON'S HOVER, NOT ITS OWN. It carried a bare `hover:`, so the
              outline lit the moment the pointer crossed the button's padding while the glyph waited for
              the pointer to reach its 12px of ink — two reactions to one target (maintainer 2026-09-26:
              "As soon as I'm hovering over the box at all, the icon and the border should both
              animate"). The group is NAMED because Tailwind's `group-hover` matches ANY `.group`
              ancestor, not the nearest one. */}

 *  behind the drawer, and a rested thread's queue card carries its own footer, so an unscoped

          delivered message, and the divider the chat renders. A panel that called them anything else
          would be the only surface with its own vocabulary.

          A THREE-COLUMN GRID (switch · name · gloss), not a flex row. Several mechanisms on one line was
          unreadable — the eye grouped "…it stops [Off|On] every 30 min" and the first control read as a
          separator between the two phrases rather than the end of the first. Stacked, each row says what
          it is and when it fires.

          THE SWITCH LEADS THE ROW, where it used to sit between the name and the gloss. Two reasons, and
          the second is the one that shows: a column of switches down the left edge is the shape every
          settings list has, so it scans as one list of booleans rather than three sentences with a
          control wedged into each; and the name column no longer has to be `auto`-sized against the
          longest label, so adding a row can never shove the controls sideways (which is precisely the
          hazard the Compaction row's comment below had to be written about).

          `items-baseline`, NOT `items-center` — the switch places itself on the text's CAP BAND and needs
          a shared baseline to do it (see ui/Switch.tsx). Centring the boxes instead read 1.45px low in
          the mono font while measuring clean in sans, which is the whole reason the correction is
          computed from `cap` rather than fitted.

          `minmax(0,1fr)`, not `1fr`, and `flex-wrap` on the rows that are a field among words: a bare `1fr`
          is at least its content's min-content, and the Limit row's "stop after [∞] runs or [∞] e.g. 30m,
          2h, 3d" is one unbreakable line — so in a 300px sidebar the grid ran 36px past the 276px panel,
          and the glosses ended mid-word at the frame's edge (2026-10-01). Where they fit nothing moves. */}

            its two neighbours, because "compaction" IS the name everything uses for it — there is no
            frizz-coined term to be consistent with. It sits last because it is the only one that fires on
            something the harness does rather than on something the thread or the clock does.

            ONE WORD, not "After compaction". It was measured rather than chosen when the name column led
            the row and sized every switch with it ("After compaction" measured 91.61px of ink in a 93px
            column at 11px/500, dragging both existing switches ~38px right for a preposition the gloss
            already supplies). The switch column leads now, so the measurement no longer binds — but the
            bare noun is still the right label, because it sits with its siblings as one list of names
            (Stop hook · Heartbeat · Compaction) rather than one name and two phrases.

            The gloss carries the INSTRUCTION, not just the timing, because this trigger is useless
            without it: the prompt has to name a doc for the emptied window to be re-grounded ON. */}
