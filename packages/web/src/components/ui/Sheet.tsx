// Below 800px a drawer covers (nearly) the whole screen, so it behaves as a MODAL: ThreadSheet renders
// a modal Radix dialog there, and a plain Sheet takes the matching scroll lock (see Sheet below).
//
// ONE LAYER HOLDS THAT LOCK: the topmost live one. react-remove-scroll lets exactly one lock decide — the
// one that MOUNTED last — and it cancels every wheel and touchmove outside that lock's own element. A
// plain sheet stacked over a thread (a `.md` reader, a sub-agent, a shell, the frizz-doc) is a sibling
// of the thread's Radix dialog, not inside it, so while the thread's lock was the deciding one the
// sheet on top rendered and would not scroll a pixel on a phone. Mount order cannot be trusted to put
// the right lock last: Radix mounts its lock a commit late (its Portal waits for a layout effect), so a
// thread that turns modal in the same commit as the sheet above it — a tablet rotated below 800px with
// a reader open — lands on top. Holding the lock in one layer at a time makes the order irrelevant.
//
// With no live layer left, the last one still sliding out keeps it until it unmounts: otherwise the
// final thread's close dropped the lock at the START of its 210ms exit, while it still covered the
// page. A closing layer above a live one never holds it — the live layer's lock must win.

// FOCUS, on a narrow screen. There a thread is a MODAL Radix dialog (ThreadSheet), whose focus scope traps
// focus inside the thread — and a plain sheet stacked on it (your terminal, a sub-agent, a reader) is a
// sibling outside that scope. So the trap pulled every focus straight back into the thread: the terminal's
// "Run another command" box never took focus on open, a click on the xterm left focus on the thread's ✕, and
// letters typed "into the terminal" fired the thread's single-key shortcuts (`echo hello` raised "Signed out
// of Claude" through `r`). Below 800px in a browser, and at every width in an editor's sidebar (2026-10-01).
//
// The fix is to be on the SAME focus-scope stack: Radix keeps one module-level stack and pauses every scope
// but the newest, so a scope of the sheet's own pauses the thread's trap for exactly as long as the sheet is
// mounted, and resumes it when the sheet goes. That stack belongs to the one copy of
// @radix-ui/react-focus-scope that react-dialog bundles, which this package does not depend on directly — so
// the scope comes from react-dialog itself: a NON-modal Dialog content, `asChild` on the panel. Non-modal,
// because a modal one would also pin `body{pointer-events:none}` and aria-hide the page, which on a phone
// with no thread under the sheet would stop a tap beside it from closing it (useOutsidePointerDismiss). Its
// scope LOOPS Tab at the panel's edges and does not trap, which is enough: the trap it pauses was the only
// thing pulling focus out, and in the sidebar the sheet covers the frame. Every dismissal Radix would add is
// refused — the sheet keeps its own (DrawerStack's Escape, useOutsidePointerDismiss) — and only a narrow
// screen gets it, so the desktop's sheets are exactly what they were (crossing 800px remounts the panel, as
// ThreadSheet's `modal` does).
