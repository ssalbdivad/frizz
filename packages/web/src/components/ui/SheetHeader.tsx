// `subtitle` line — e.g. a doc drawer's "<slug>.md"), optional trailing `actions` (settings' "● unsaved"),
// and the lucide close button. Replaces six near-identical hand-rolled headers that had drifted in
// height (h-11 vs h-12), padding (px-3 / px-4 / px-5), title weight, and close-button padding.
//
// `initialFocus` stamps data-dialog-initial-focus on the close button for Radix/focus managers that
// query it (ThreadSheet's onOpenAutoFocus / registerDrawerFocus); omitted, the attribute is absent.

  // THE TEXT BLOCK IS ONE WRAPPING LINE OF THREE PIECES — title, meta, subtitle — so a narrow drawer can move
  // the meta down beside the subtitle rather than squeeze the title to nothing. Wide: title and meta share
  // the first line (the subtitle, `basis-full`, is always the second). The title grows from zero up to its own
  // width (`basis-0 grow max-w-max`), so it never pushes the meta off the line; it truncates first, and the
  // meta keeps up to 70%. Under 28rem (a size container around the header — TerminalSheet's; without one
  // nothing here changes): the title takes the first line alone, and the meta leads the second. At 390px the
  // one-line header drew `read…` beside `waiting for input…` and `Test …` beside `running · 34m left · 2…`
  // (2026-09-30): neither what the drawer is nor a whole reading.
  //
  // THE SECOND LINE, UNDER 28rem, IS ITS OWN ROW that never wraps: the meta and the subtitle in one flex line
  // (a `contents` box wide, so nothing changes there). It was the same wrapping line as the title, the meta
  // `shrink-0` up to 70% and the subtitle sized from zero — so `waiting for input · 4m` took what it wanted
  // and the folder's path shrank to 0px, leaving an orphaned ` · worktree`, cut mid-word (`· workt`) at 390px
  // (2026-09-30). Now the meta keeps its natural width only while the subtitle's kept part fits beside it
  // (`subtitleKeeps`); past that it is the meta that gives way — its age wraps off whole, then its state
  // word ellipsizes (StateReading) — and the subtitle grows into whatever is left.
  //
  // BASELINES, not centres: the meta is a smaller run beside the title, and centring two sizes on one flex
  // line put the agent drawer's reading 1.06px under the title's baseline (sans 13px title) and your
  // terminal's 0.30px over it (mono 12.5px) — one header anatomy seating its reading two ways. `items-baseline`
  // puts every run on the title's baseline in any font, with nothing measured.
