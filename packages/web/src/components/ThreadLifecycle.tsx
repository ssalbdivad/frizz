// THE WHOLE-THREAD LIFECYCLE VERBS, at the far right of a thread header's action strip: an alarm clock
// that snoozes and a check that marks the thread done. Both headers render it — the queue card's and the
// thread view's (the drawer and /full) — so the two surfaces cannot drift.
//
// They lived in a footer strip under the prompt box until 2026-10-05, beside the context reading and
// the goal. The maintainer gave the thread's two edges one job each: the HEADER manages the thread as a
// whole (what it is, how full its context is, the views onto it, the verbs that park or finish it), and
// the BOTTOM steers the run (what is outstanding, the prompt box, the goal beside send). "Everything
// that's like chat management stuff … goes in the top, and then stuff that relates to the current
// running of the chat and ways to steer it go … in the prompt box at the bottom." So the context reading
// moved up beside "Last active" (ContextMeter), the goal moved into the prompt box's rail
// (RecurringPromptControl), and the footer went.
//
// BARE ICONS in the strip's own 28px squares, not the labelled buttons they replace — "those icons are
// both just incredibly clear what they are" — with their names one hover away like every other header
// icon. A hairline rule holds them apart from the view controls before them; `mx-2.5` puts 20px of ink
// before it and 19.5px after it on a real queue card, the strip's own icon-to-icon rhythm (20–21px;
// clock to check 18.25px), so the rule groups without crowding (scripts/ink-gaps.mjs, dsf 4,
// 2026-10-05). After the Retry PILL the left margin widens (styles.css, `[data-header-pill]`): a
// bordered pill has no dead space, and on `mx-2.5` it sat 12px off the rule against 19.5px on the other
// side. The check is LAST: it is the verb a resting card most often ends on.
//
// A DONE thread states the state instead of offering the verbs (DoneReadout), because there is no
// Reopen — a message reopens it. An unowned thread gets nothing at all: frizz recorded no lifecycle for
// it to vouch for.
