// THE FULLSCREEN DOOR, CLOSING — ExpandThreadLink's exact counterpart, and it stands in the exact
// place: HeaderActions' `expand` slot, so the icon that took the reader to /full and the icon that
// brings them back occupy one position in one strip (maintainer 2026-09-02: "instead of a back arrow
// in the upper left, I think we should just have a collapse icon in the same place where the expand
// icon is in the cue card").
//
// It replaced an ArrowLeft that sat before the TITLE, at the header's far left — a second, unrelated
// place to look for a whole-thread verb, and a glyph that says "previous page" about a control whose
// job is to change how this thread is being SHOWN.
//
// A real anchor, for the same reasons as the door out: ⌘/middle/right-click and "copy link address"
// need no code, and a plain left click becomes a react-router navigation through lib/router's
// registered navigator. `data-standalone-return` is kept from the arrow — it names the FUNCTION, which
// has not changed.

  // A thread read through a DRAWER has no surface on the board root, so landing there both stranded
  // the reader and left the reverse morph with nothing named to shrink into — it cross-faded at every
  // width. `/thread/<slug>` is that drawer's own address, and BoardRoute re-mounts and names it.
  //
  // The fallback is the queue, and it is THIS project's queue, not the launching one's — and a BOARD,
  // not the project picker. A bare "/" sent a reader who opened `/project/nub/thread/x/full` to
  // whichever board the server was started from, and on the launching project it sent them to the grid.
  // It is what a COLD arrival at /full gets: a deep link, a bookmark, a reload — no door was pressed,
  // so there is nowhere to go back to and the queue is the honest destination.
