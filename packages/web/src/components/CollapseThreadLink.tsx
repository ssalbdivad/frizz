// A thread read through a DRAWER has no surface on the page root, so landing there both stranded
// the reader and left the reverse morph with nothing named to shrink into — it cross-faded at every
// width. `/all/<project>/thread/<slug>` is that drawer's own address, and CrossProjectPage re-mounts
// and names it.
//
// A COLD arrival at /full — a deep link, a bookmark, a reload — noted no door, and gets the same
// drawer: fullscreen is a way of showing ONE thread, so leaving it shows that thread the ordinary
// way, on the page, rather than dropping the reader on a page it was never opened from. The
// launching project's unprefixed /full names no project to open a drawer in, so it goes home.

// the POP of a pair that transitioned.

// THE FULLSCREEN DOOR, CLOSING — the counterpart of the drawer menu's "Open fullscreen" (ThreadMenu.tsx),
// in the /full page's own action strip (HeaderActions `collapse`). It stood in the queue card's expand
// slot while cards had one (maintainer 2026-09-02: "instead of a back arrow in the upper left, I think we
// should just have a collapse icon in the same place where the expand icon is in the cue card"); cards
// lost theirs on 2026-09-28, when /full became an option in the drawer rather than a door on every card.
//
// It replaced an ArrowLeft that sat before the TITLE, at the header's far left — a second, unrelated
// place to look for a whole-thread verb, and a glyph that says "previous page" about a control whose
// job is to change how this thread is being SHOWN.
//
// A real anchor, for the same reasons as the door out: ⌘/middle/right-click and "copy link address"
// need no code, and a plain left click becomes a react-router navigation through lib/router's
// registered navigator. `data-standalone-return` is kept from the arrow — it names the FUNCTION, which
// has not changed.
