// THE MACHINE'S HOME PAGE: every project Frizz knows about, one card each, and a way to add another.
//
// It renders at `/` and nothing else; a project's own board lives at `/project/<slug>`, which is what
// freed the root. The RAIL and the tooltip provider are NOT here — they belong to the layout route
// that stays mounted across a navigation (routes.tsx), which is what stops the rail rebuilding itself
// every time you use it.
//
// It draws entirely from the registry index — one file read, no databases opened. Answering a list
// request by opening forty projects is exactly the cost lazy activation exists to avoid, so a card
// deliberately shows only what the index holds. (The server does open them all in the background about
// a second after boot — server/tenant-prime.ts — but on its own clock, never on a request's.)

          13 is its 1px border plus `px-3`, and the square is centred in the link, so `top-1/2` plus the
          translate centres this on it. The phone row (MOBILE_ROW) drops the side and top borders and

          — measured 2026-08-24: 1px left and 0.5px low without these. It draws nothing until the
          pointer is over the square, when a scrim and an image glyph say "this changes the picture" —
          the scrim at 75%, because at 60% a monogram's letters and a logo's strokes still showed
          through and tangled with the glyph (measured at dsf 6, 2026-08-24). It stays lit while its
          menu is open (Radix stamps `data-state` on the trigger) and for a keyboard user once focused.
          It sat in the card's bottom-right corner until 2026-08-24, where nothing tied it to the
          picture it changed (maintainer: hover the logo, or lack thereof, and the button should appear
          there). Hovering the square now hits this, not the link, so the square is no longer part of

          THE OFFSET IS INK, NOT BOX. The card's left inset is 13px — its 1px border plus `px-3` — and
          the square is a filled tile whose ink IS its box, so that is what the eye reads there. The

          9px of dead space a side (measured 2026-08-26). 4 + 9 = the same 13, so the two ends of the
          card balance; at the old 17px inset this was `right-[4px]`, and `right-[5px]` had put the
          mark at 14 where it read as crowding the border. The phone row (MOBILE_ROW) drops the side
          borders and pads 16, so there it is 7.
          It is revealed by the CARD's hover rather than its own, because a control nobody can see until
