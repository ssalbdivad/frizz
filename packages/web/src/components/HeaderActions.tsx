//   • SESSION (non-foreign): the fullscreen door, plus Retry on exactly the threads `offersRetry`
//     picks — the STALLED ones (the rail's yellow [!]) and the ones KILLED by a usage limit frizz will
//     auto-resume (the yellow hourglass, offered the same one-click continue). Every surface that renders this
//     component reads that same derivation, so the verb can never disagree between the card, the header
//     and the rail. The live-process maintenance verbs (Reload plugins, Restart worker), the copy
//     terminal command and the Frizz document sat here until 2026-09-29; they are the drawer's ⋯ menu
//     items now (ThreadMenu.tsx).
//     Other lifecycle verbs (Mark as done / Snooze) live in ThreadLifecycleFooter; the AI rename
//     refresh is revealed by the title's own hover, in both this component's surfaces.
//   • SESSION (foreign): read-only. Only the doc/open NAVIGATION affordances — no kill/archive.
//   • LEGACY (kind !== "session"): the vestigial Mark-as split button, exactly as before.
