// THE PAGE'S QUEUE CARD (components/AllQueuesCard.tsx) in the states its tests covered on the board's card
// until 098de26d deleted them with their fixture (2026-09-28). The behaviour never went: it lives in the
// shared StateButton (ThreadLifecycleFooter.tsx), which the card wires with onArchived/onDismissCancel, and
// in the page's own exit hook (AllQueues.tsx useLeavingCards) — both run here for real, on
// queue-card-states-fixture.html, with only the network stubbed.
//
//   1-3  the OPTIMISTIC Mark as done: the card fades BEFORE completeThread returns; a needsConfirmation
//        reply puts it back and opens the End-session dialog naming the live work; a failed RPC rolls it
//        back. Port of queueOptimisticDone.e2e.test.ts (7a20f425).
//   4    a reply that steers the card away dissolves it, and its neighbour survives the thread then dropping
//        out of the queue — what queueSteerDissolve.e2e.test.ts pinned on the board's queue until 098de26d.
//   4b   a reply still on the wire past REAPPEAR_MS keeps its card gone: the card came back without the
//        reply, then left again once the worker picked it up (maintainer 2026-09-30).
//   5-6  a done the worker REGISTERED (`mcp__frizz__done`) draws its Done card on the queue card, and one
//        both fenced and registered draws exactly one (B1, restored 2026-09-29).
//   7-9  the terminal net: a frozen native ask and a bare permission prompt — two states the server queues a
//        thread on without journaling an interaction — draw their card, the copy asks the CARD's project
//        for the command, and the net stands down when an answerable interaction is journaled (B2).
//
// Skipped unless a Vite URL serving the fixtures is provided: `nub run test:e2e` sets it, or start
