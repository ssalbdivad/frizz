// THE PAGE'S QUEUE CARD (components/AllQueuesCard.tsx) in the states its tests covered on the board's card
// until 098de26d deleted them with their fixture (2026-09-28). The behaviour never went: it lives in the
// shared StateButton (ThreadLifecycle.tsx), which the card wires with onArchived/onDismissCancel, and
// in the page's own exit hook (AllQueues.tsx useLeavingCards) — both run here for real, on
// queue-card-states-fixture.html, with only the network stubbed.
//
//   1-3  the OPTIMISTIC Mark as done: the card fades BEFORE completeThread returns; a needsConfirmation
//        reply puts it back and opens the End-session dialog naming the live work; a failed RPC rolls it
//        back. Port of queueOptimisticDone.e2e.test.ts (7a20f425).
//   4    a reply that steers the card away dissolves it, and its neighbour survives the thread then dropping
//        out of the queue — what queueSteerDissolve.e2e.test.ts pinned on the board's queue until 098de26d.
//   4b   a reply still on the wire past REAPPEAR_MS keeps its card gone: the card came back without the
//        reply, then left again once the worker picked it up (maintainer 2026-09-30).
//   4c   a poll that started before Mark as done cannot bring the card back however late it lands, and a
//        fresh one that still lists the thread does (maintainer 2026-09-30).
//   5-6  a done the worker REGISTERED (`mcp__frizz__done`) draws its Done card on the queue card, and one
//        both fenced and registered draws exactly one (B1, restored 2026-09-29).
//   10   a park queued only for its unread reply reads "Replied", and Mark as read records it seen and
//        takes the card out (maintainer 2026-10-01 on @expand-defaults).
//   11   a rest handing the human `steps:` draws the drawer's steps card ON THE QUEUE CARD — numbered steps
//        under the worker's title, one Done — and Done replies "Done" into the CARD's project and takes
//        the card out at once (upstream fe668a8d; the card drew the fence as bare prose until 2026-10-06).
//   12   a rest on a declared agent terminal draws the resting card, whose event-snooze parks the thread
//        through the card's project and takes the card out.
//   13   each question at the rest that asked it (upstream e157817a, 22084580): one asked two rests ago
//        sits under the reply that asked it, over the newest rest, which is bare and so draws "Reply to
//        continue" beside the older question; one the newest rest asked sits under it with no such card.
//        The transcript that places them is read through the CARD's project.
//   14   "Show earlier messages" opens the transcript IN the card, one round back past the human's last
//        message, with the middle rounds behind "N more rounds"; "Load earlier messages" pages back with the
//        message on screen held still; the fold expands; the header's collapse folds the card to its
//        header and back. Every read goes to the card's project.
//   15   on that transcript view a question sits after the message of the rest that asked it.
//   7-9  the terminal net: a frozen native ask and a bare permission prompt — two states the server queues a
//        thread on without journaling an interaction — draw their card, the copy asks the CARD's project
//        for the command, and the net stands down when an answerable interaction is journaled (B2).
