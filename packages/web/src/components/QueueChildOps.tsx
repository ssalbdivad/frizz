// A QUEUE CARD'S LIVE WORK — every sub-agent and Workflow the thread has running, in one column, WHATEVER
// THE WORKER IS DOING, with the card's terminals hung under them in the same column.
//
// IN THE OPS PANEL since 2026-10-06. The column hung under the card's reply box until the box docked to
// the bottom of the screen (upstream's queue dock, 199adf2c): a dock cannot carry a column of rows, so the
// rows fold into one line of counts above it (QueueOpsSummary) and this column is what its hover panel
// shows. The rows are unchanged — same component, same order, same drill-in and ×.
//
// Until 2026-09-29 a card named its children only inside AwaitingSubAgentsCard, which is drawn in place of
// the worker's ```awaiting fence — at rest, with that fence, and no question open. Anything else drew
// none: a card held on screen while its worker ran the answer to one of its questions, a quiet-turn card,
// a done or a question beside live children, and every card from the moment a human reply retired the
// fence until the worker rested again. The maintainer, replying to a parent with children running: it "no
// longer appears to be running anything". The rail (Sidebar SubAgentCount) and the drawer's strip under
// its prompt box (ChatView BackgroundOpsStrip) read `subAgents` with no such gate; now the card does too.
//
// THE DRAWER'S STRIP, REPRODUCED. The same ChildOpRow at the drawer's own "sheet" density — dot, kind tag
// (AGENT / FLOW), label, age, × — in dispatch order with their subtrees indented, so a card reads exactly
// like the prompt box it opens into. When the awaiting card IS drawn it lists the children with their
// returned siblings, so `agents` is off here.
//
// THE TERMINALS ARE NOT THIS COLUMN'S ROWS. Every terminal on a thread, the agent's and the human's, is one
// TERM row in ThreadTerminals' process strip — its budget, its folder hint and its drawer included — which
// the card hands in as `after`, so it hangs in this same column and inset, under the AGENT / FLOW rows and
// on their label column. This column drew its own SHELL rows until then; with the strip on every card they
// were never drawn, and were removed.
//
// NOT BackgroundOpsStrip itself, which reads the PAGE's board (useBoard) and stops through the page's
// `rpc` — on the cross-project page both name the FOCUSED project, which is usually not the card's. The
// thread, the ×, and the drill-in all come from the CARD's own project here.
