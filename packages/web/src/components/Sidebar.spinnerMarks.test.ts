// THE SPINNER IS THE FRAME, THE MARK INSIDE SAYS WHAT IS ALIVE (2026-09-20). The maintainer's rule for
// the Running band: "everything in the running rail should always have this spinner animation going —
// an empty square if the thread is actively running, a blue dot if there's a background shell, a solid,
// non-pulsing blue dot", and for a parent resting on its sub-agents "the three ellipses for the top-level
// parent agent with the spinner, and then the sub-agents can have their own spinners". A PR wait joins
// the family while its checks run (maintainer: it "should just stay in the running rail if it's actively
// waiting on checks") and drops back to the static octocat once they settle.
//
// AND SINCE 2026-10-05 AN AT-REST MARK SPINS ONLY ON A `working` REST (ThreadView.waitStatus, groups
// .restIsWorking). The dot and the octocat keep their glyphs everywhere; the frame around them moves only
// in the Running band. A queued rest stands still whatever is running behind it, and a `watching` rest
// stands still in Snoozed (maintainer 2026-10-03: a watcher "shouldn't show up as actively running").
//
// The spinner is identified by its <animate> child — the one element in the family that only the
// BoxSpinner renders — and the inner marks by lucide's stamped class or the dot's own class. Asserting
// on rendered markup rather than on element types is what pins the COMPOSITION: an ellipsis and a
// spinner both present is a different picture from either alone.
