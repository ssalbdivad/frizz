// THE STATUS ROW — one loose line along the TOP OF THE PROMPT BOX: the page's title at the left, then,
// pushed to the right end, the app's controls and its readouts:
//
//   ▣ acme-api ▾                settings · shortcuts · reload │ Claude 83% · Codex 59%
//
// and on a project's BOARD (`/project/<slug>`, ProjectBoard.tsx), led by the door home and followed by the
// project's repo — upstream's crumb and identity, which the board brought back on 2026-10-06:
//
//   ⌂ │ ▣ acme-api ▾  acme/api …      settings · shortcuts · reload │ Claude 83% · Codex 59%
//
// THE TITLE is the project switcher (ProjectSwitcher.tsx), handed in as `title` — the page's one name for
// what it shows, where a workspace switcher sits in Linear, Slack or Vercel (David 2026-09-29). It
// sat over the queue until then, muted, and read as a filter on the cards rather than the scope of the
// whole page; the list's own project header repeated the name 180px away.
//
// It rides the page's prompt box, at the top of its left column (AllQueues.tsx).
//
// IT IS LOOSE, NOT A CHIP. Until 2026-08-19 this was a FIXED bar pinned to the page's upper-left
// corner with its own fill, hairline and shadow — a screen's width away from the column it described,
// and opaque because a full sidebar or a scrolling narrow rail would otherwise paint through it
// (maintainer: "move the top left status bar contents s.t. they are loose along the top of the sidebar
// prompt box"). In the column there is nothing to pass behind it, so the surface is gone: no fill, no
// border, no shadow, no z-index. Its two ends land on the composer's own border, which is what makes a
// borderless strip read as belonging to the box below it.
//
// THE DOOR HOME, ON A BOARD ONLY (`crumb`). It goes to All projects, at `/all`: the board is the default
// view, but All projects is the level above it, the one that holds every board (2026-10-06; it was the
// bare `/` until then, and `/` now only goes back to the last view, which from a board is the board). All
// projects has no door: there is nowhere above it to go (David 2026-09-28: "there should no longer be
// an everything or an infinity button on the threads view on the left"). Upstream led its board's row
// with ⌂, the way out to its projects page at `/` (colinhacks/frizz 0a3b9139 StatusRow.tsx) — a router
// Link, so leaving keeps the socket and the query cache. A divider follows it: home LEAVES the board, the
// rest act on what you are in. The
// board's `identity` (ProjectBoard.tsx BoardIdentity) rides beside the switcher: the project's owner/repo
// linking to it on GitHub (upstream maintainer 2026-08-28: "Perhaps it should actually be showing
// owner/repo if a repo is detected"), and its ⋯ menu, which in All projects is on the project's row. The
// connection indicator went on 2026-08-28: its one informative state, disconnected, is one the page also
// shows by going stale.
//
// ONE DIVIDER, between the buttons and the readouts.
//
// THE GAP IS 12px OF INK, not 12px of box — the same law lib/iconRhythm.ts states for the thread
// footer, solved for a strip that mixes 24px icon squares, hairlines, quota pills and a name. Each of
// those wears a different amount of dead space inside its own layout box, so a uniform `gap-2` drew six
// different distances (measured 2026-08-14, `scripts/ink-gaps.mjs --pad=0`, every CSS gap 8px) ranging
// 8.00px to 20.00px — a 2.5× spread on one provably uniform gap. The fix is per-mark, not per-gap:
// STATUS_ROW_ACTION collapses each icon square onto its glyph's ink, and then this one `gap-3` is the
// whole rhythm. Readings for the current row are in StatusRow.test.ts.

/**
 * Reads its live values itself; `title` is the page's name, drawn first. `settings` and `shortcuts` false
 * drop the gear and the ⌨: in an editor's sidebar the title row VS Code draws over the frame carries both
 * (Settings as a button, Keyboard shortcuts under its ⋯), and the page's name (SidebarPage.tsx), so the
 * row there is the rest of it, at the right end — and NOTHING when there is no rest. With no supervisor to
 * restart (a Frizz run from source) and no quota to read, the ⌨ stood alone on a 36px row above the prompt
 * box, a stray glyph the real-page run flagged as debris (scripts/e2e-sidebar.ts, 2026-10-01); a row of
 * nothing would still hold the box 10px down, so the row is not drawn at all.
