// THE STATUS ROW — one loose line along the TOP OF THE PROMPT BOX, controls at the left edge and the
// project at the right:
//
//   ∞ │ settings · reload │ Claude 83% · Codex 59%                            owner/repo
//
// It rides the dispatch composer wherever that composer is: the sidebar's own top on a normal board,
// and the centered first-task box on a brand-new project (TodosView's `nothingAtAll` branch), which
// hides the sidebar entirely. Anywhere you can start a thread, this is above it.
//
// IT IS LOOSE, NOT A CHIP. Until 2026-08-19 this was a FIXED bar pinned to the page's upper-left
// corner with its own fill, hairline and shadow — a screen's width away from the column it described,
// and opaque because a full sidebar or a scrolling narrow rail would otherwise paint through it
// (maintainer: "move the top left status bar contents s.t. they are loose along the top of the sidebar
// prompt box"). In the column there is nothing to pass behind it, so the surface is gone: no fill, no
// border, no shadow, no z-index. Its two ends land on the composer's own border, which is what makes a
// borderless strip read as belonging to the box below it.
//
// CONTROLS LEFT, IDENTITY RIGHT (maintainer 2026-08-19). The row briefly ran the other way — identity
// leading, controls and quota trailing — which reads as a heading with its buttons pushed away. This
// way the left edge is one uninterrupted run of things you can press, and the project name anchors the
// right edge as the row's one piece of prose.
//
// TWO DIVIDERS, NOT ONE, and the first one is the point: ∞ LEAVES this project, while settings and
// reload act on the app you are already in. One divider would group all three as "buttons"; two say
// the first one is a door out. The second divider separates the buttons from the readouts.
//
// THE PROJECT IS A LINK TO ITS REPO, AND THE CONNECTION INDICATOR IS GONE (maintainer 2026-08-28:
// "There should be a way to open up the GitHub repo for a given project if one is detected … Perhaps
// it should actually be showing owner/repo if a repo is detected … then maybe we should just drop the
// status indicator"). The connection had already been reduced from a green dot plus the word
// "connected" to the dot alone on 2026-08-19 ("drop the connected indicator, certainly. It's pretty
// useless"); the dot then said "green" every second of every session, and its one informative state —
// disconnected — is something the page ALSO tells you by going stale. The name is a real
// `<a target=_blank>` rather than a scripted window.open, so ⌘-click, middle-click and copy-link all
// work — and it links only when the board carries `githubRepo` (origin is github.com), so a GitLab
// origin or a remote-less directory shows its name as plain text.
//
// NO GITHUB MARK BESIDE IT. The first cut put GitHub's mark in the dot's old slot as the link's
// affordance; the maintainer pulled it the same day ("it kind of conflicts with the GitHub icon that
// shows up in the prompt box" — the picker's door, a few px below this row, is the one GitHub glyph
// on the surface and it means "browse issues and PRs", not "this repo"). The link shows itself the
// way every other text link in the app does: full-fg + underline on hover, and a title that says
// where it goes.
//
// THE 272px SIDEBAR IS THE BINDING WIDTH, not the viewport. The old bar was capped to the VIEWPORT, so
// it never ran out of room; this row lives in a column that floors at 272px in the tablet band. With
// the connection word still in it the repo name truncated to "f…" at an 820px viewport — the one
// reading that must survive was the first one dropped. Showing owner/repo makes that binding again:
// "colinhacks/frizz" does not fit beside two quota chips at 272px, so the name truncates from the
// START (`direction: rtl` on the clipping span, the text isolated LTR inside it) and it is the OWNER
// that gives way — "…hacks/frizz", never "colinhacks/f…". Any NEW mark added here has to be re-checked
// at 820px.
//
// THE GAP IS 12px OF INK, not 12px of box — the same law lib/iconRhythm.ts states for the thread
// footer, solved for a strip that mixes 24px icon squares, hairlines, quota pills and a name. Each of
// those wears a different amount of dead space inside its own layout box, so a uniform `gap-2` drew six
// different distances (measured 2026-08-14, `scripts/ink-gaps.mjs --pad=0`, every CSS gap 8px) ranging
// 8.00px to 20.00px — a 2.5× spread on one provably uniform gap. The fix is per-mark, not per-gap:
// STATUS_ROW_ACTION collapses each icon square onto its glyph's ink, and then this one `gap-3` is the
// whole rhythm. Readings for the current row are in StatusRow.test.ts.

  return <span aria-hidden="true" className="h-3 w-px shrink-0 bg-border" />

// The name, clipped from the START. A plain `truncate` keeps the head of the string and drops the
// tail, which for "owner/repo" throws away the repo — the one half worth keeping. `direction: rtl` on
// the clipping box moves the overflow (and the ellipsis) to the left edge; the text itself is
// re-isolated LTR (`unicode-bidi: isolate` + `direction: ltr`) so its letters and the slash keep their
// order. NOTE the string must end in a strong LTR character for this to hold — a trailing neutral
// (punctuation) would jump to the other end under rtl, and a repo name cannot end in one.

      {/* THE DOOR OUT — Everything, every project's queue on one page. ONE door since 2026-09-24: a house
          (the project grid) stood beside it until the grid folded into Everything, and two ways "up" from
          one board asked the reader to choose between pages that were never meant to be different
          places. The infinity is the maintainer's glyph for Everything.
          From a board it opens FOCUSED on this board's project, so the prompt box there still dispatches
          where you were working — but showing everything, never narrowed. On the page itself it is the
          way back from a narrowed view to everything, and so it navigates nowhere: a click widens the page
          and returns to its top (a trip through `/` would remount the page under the operator). It is
          current exactly when the page shows everything.
          A 24px target like its neighbours, and a ROUTER Link: it was a raw `<a href="/">` from 2026-08-19
          until 2026-09-04, which hard-loaded the document — measured at 116-411ms with a 0.15 CLS, and it
          threw away the app socket and the whole query cache on the way out. The rail is hidden under
          800px and off by default, so THIS is the door most operators use. No `-ml-px` ink trim of its
          own, unlike the house it replaced: the infinity's stroke reaches one unit further out in lucide's
          24-unit box (x=1 against the house's x=2), which is that pixel already. */}
