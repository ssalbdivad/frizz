// A QUEUED WAIT ON A TIMER WEARS THE HOURGLASS, NOT THE SHELL'S DOT (2026-09-07). A timer park queues
// (board.deriveNeedsYou keeps it a visible handoff), so its row sits in the Rested band — and there,
// from 2026-08-24, it wore the pulsing blue dot: groups.restingOnLiveBackgroundWork counted an armed
// timer as motion. The dot is the rail's word for "a process it launched is still running", and nothing
// runs behind a timer (maintainer: "an item in the queue that's awaiting a timer should show up with the
// hourglass icon in the sidebar, not with the flashing blue dot").
//
// Two halves, pinned on two surfaces. The MARK is asserted on the rendered markup — lucide stamps its
// icon name onto the <svg>, and the dot is a styled span (Sidebar.tsx shellDot) matched by class. The
// TIP is asserted through the sessionIndicatorFor seam, because a Radix tooltip renders nothing until
// it opens and static markup cannot see it.
