//   rail  — the sidebar's indented child rows. The [ ]/[/] checkbox motif (BoxSpinner) that the whole
//           rail speaks, at 12px, indented to clear the parent row's indicator column. NEVER swap this
//           for the pulsing dot: matching the parent rows is the point. The rail keeps carrying the raw
//           subagent type in its tooltip, which is now the only place it appears at all.
//   card  — a queue card's live child lines: the pulsing live dot and the label, no kind tag.
//   sheet — the drawer's background-ops strip: dot + petite-caps kind tag + label.
// The dismiss × is NOT one of those differences any more — see `onDismiss`.
// All three carry the light-gray DURATION the child has been working — right-justified at the end of the
// row (maintainer 2026-07-27), so a column of rows reads its numbers down one edge instead of at
// whatever ragged offset each label happens to end. It reads at the SAME size as the title and every
// other reading on the row; the size lives on the container for exactly that reason.

// child with no id. Every token it draws comes from lib/childOps.ts.
//
// WHAT THE ROW DELIBERATELY NO LONGER CARRIES (maintainer 2026-07-27, on the rows under the prompt box):
//   • the ↗ hover glyph — the drill-in affordance is the TITLE itself (it underlines on hover and is
//     the button), so a second, quieter icon saying the same thing was noise;
//   • the bracketed model+effort tag — the profile belongs to the prompt box's own control one line up,
//     not repeated on every child line.
//
// POLICY for a child with no `id` (nothing to drill into): a NON-INTERACTIVE row — a plain <div> with
// the same layout, no hover, no focus stop. Never a `disabled` button (which announces an affordance
// that isn't there) and never a dropped row (which silently hides live work). Same rule on all three
// densities: `onOpen` absent ⇒ non-interactive, present ⇒ a real button.
