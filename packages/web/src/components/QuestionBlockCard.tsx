// THE question card — the single component every question in frizz renders through, whatever produced
// it. There are two producers and one look:
//
//   1. a ```question fence in an assistant message (lib/questionBlocks.ts parses the markdown), and
//   2. a NATIVE AskUserQuestion tool call from the Claude session broker, whose interaction record is
//      converted to the same model by lib/interactionQuestion.ts.
//
// They share a data model, which is why they can share a component: a question, numbered options each
// with a one-line trade-off, an optional "select several" mode, and a free-text box at the bottom. The
// tool call's `multiSelect` IS the fence's `multi` tag; its `options[].label/description` ARE the
// fence's option lines. Anything that reads as a difference between them is a bug in a producer, not a
// reason for a second card (maintainer 2026-07-27: "Ideally, they could share a component").
//
// It lives in its own module rather than in ChatView so BOTH producers can reach it: the interaction
// surface (InteractionCards.tsx) is imported BY ChatView, so a question card defined inside ChatView
// could only have been shared through a module cycle.

// recommendedIndex (rec-line → option index) now lives in ../lib/questionBlocks.ts alongside the rest
// of the question parsing, so it's covered by the pure-logic unit tests.

// A single answer choice: a left-aligned neutral row; when selected it takes the subtle accent
// border (focus-adjacent selection). A `multi` chip additionally carries a checkbox square (empty →
// checked) so the "toggle several" affordance reads unmistakably as multi-select vs the single-select
// chips' bare border highlight. Read-only (no interactive controller) → muted and non-clickable.
//
// THE HIT AREA IS A STRETCHED, EMPTY BUTTON LAID OVER THE ROW — not a button wrapped around the text.
// The option text is worker-authored markdown, and it carries the same live things a paragraph does: a
// link, a `#123` reference, a bare URL, a file path (maintainer 2026-08-25: "the link to that Markdown
// file should be clickable … as well as URLs and PR/issue links inside questions — the usual set of
// augmentations"). None of those may sit INSIDE a `<button>`: interactive-in-interactive is invalid
// HTML, and Gecko retargets a click inside a button to the button, so the link would never open. So
// the row is a plain `<div>`; the button is `absolute inset-0` beside the text, named by the text
// through `aria-labelledby`; and styles.css positions each live element in the text ABOVE the button.
// A click on a link follows it and selects nothing; a click on any other pixel of the row picks the
// option. Tab reaches the button first and each link after it. Until this the chip asked the sanitizer
// to flatten links to spans (`inertInteractive`), which is why a file named in an option never opened.
