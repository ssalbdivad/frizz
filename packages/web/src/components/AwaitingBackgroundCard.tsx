// THE resting card — one card, three surfaces. A thread whose top-level turn has come to rest while
// its OWN dispatched work (sub-agents / launched background shells) is still live is not stalled and is
// not waiting on the human: it is waiting on results it kicked off. Server-derived
// (board.deriveAwaitingBackground); this module only renders it.
//
// It renders on the DRAWER and the FULL-SCREEN page, because the rest is a fact about the thread. On the
// QUEUE it renders too — but only for the shape that queues, and the event-Snooze is passed in as
// `actions` there (parking a card is a queue verb, and the queue is where a card you don't want to look
// at costs you something). The drawer and standalone page pass none, since you opened the thread
// deliberately and have nothing to dismiss (maintainer 2026-07-25: "in the drawer or in the full screen
// view, it should not").
//
// WHICH SHAPE QUEUES has flipped twice, and the current split is the point of this card's two voices:
//   • rest on a live SUB-AGENT — excused from the queue (board.deriveNeedsYou, 2026-07-30). The child
//     returns and re-invokes the parent within seconds, so the thread is mid-flight in substance and
//     there is nothing for the human to do. The drawer and the full-screen page are then the ONLY places
//     this state is stated in words, which raises the stakes on the card rather than lowering them.
//   • rest on a background SHELL alone — QUEUED (maintainer 2026-08-04: "if a thread has rested and the
//     only thing remaining is background shells, we should put it into the queue"). A shell is detached;
//     the thread has finished its turn in every sense that matters to the operator, so it is a handoff.
//     Shells were briefly excused too (2026-08-01) and that is what this reverses.
//
// Without it those surfaces showed NOTHING at rest: the shimmer stops and the transcript just ends,
// which reads as "the agent died" for exactly the threads that are healthiest. (The shimmer coming back
// on afterwards is CORRECT, not a bug — a child's <task-notification> lands as a re-invoking user record
// and the parent genuinely resumes; measured 15/15 times on a live worker thread, with idle windows as
// short as 0.13s. This card is what makes that alternation legible.)

// different state on a different surface — it is genuinely awaiting a result, and calling it "background
// shells" would name work it never launched — so it keeps the older title.
//
// THE AWAITING TITLE IS ONE WORD (maintainer 2026-08-24, off the round-5 mockups: "The title should
// just say 'Awaiting'"). "Awaiting background work" was carrying the specifics the card now states
// better below it — the worker's own prose and a row per thing — so the heading only has to name the
// STATE. The shell-only title survives because that shape is not awaiting anything and its name was
// ruled explicitly.
//
// The GLYPH follows the title. An hourglass is a WAIT, which is true of the sub-agent rest and false of
// the shell one: a queued handoff behind a detached shell is not waiting on anything, and stamping the
// wait mark on it would contradict the whole reason it is in the queue.
// NO KIND-SPECIFIC TITLE FOR A WATCHER. This briefly read "PR watcher armed" here, which quietly
// rebuilt the very card the consolidation removed — a bespoke PR-watcher card, just on a different
// surface (maintainer 2026-08-13: "the card that you're showing me still says 'PR watcher armed'. It is
// not a generic card, snooze card. I thought we decided to go generic").
//
// So the kind-naming title survives for EXACTLY the case the maintainer named it for — a rest on
// background shells and nothing else (2026-08-04) — and every other shape takes the generic one. That
// keeps it honest in both directions: "Background shells running" never names work the thread did not
// launch, and no new kind gets a heading of its own. The sentence beneath is where the specifics live.
//
// THE WORKER MAY NAME IT ITSELF (maintainer 2026-08-26: "let's let the agent specify its own title for
// these awaiting cards"). A `title:` in the fence frontmatter wins over both derived headings, because
// only the worker knows what this particular wait IS — "Awaiting" is true of every park and specific to
// none. It WRAPS, and it is capped at parse time (AWAITING_TITLE_MAX) only so a worker cannot write a
// paragraph into a heading: the card already carries its full prose one line below.

// in the UI. We should basically have it evoke the GitHub UI that shows up for running versus completed
// checks."
//
// So the row is GitHub's merge box on ONE line: its own state glyph, the ref, the check counts and the
// merge verdict. The count VOCABULARY is GitHub's, because the human has just come from there and a
// second set of words for one fact is a second thing to learn.
//
// IT WAS THREE LINES UNTIL 2026-08-14 — a prose verdict ("All checks have passed"), the same verdict as
// counts ("— 7 successful"), and a merge sentence under it ("This branch has no conflicts with the base
// branch") — and four PRs then filled eleven lines with three ways of saying green (maintainer: "this
// looks busy and shitty"). Each fact now appears exactly once, in its shortest true form:
//   • the GLYPH carries the verdict, so the words carry only what the glyph cannot: the numbers.
//   • the counts drop the prose headline that restated them.
//   • the merge verdict joins the same line, and only when it is not already implied (below).
//

// versus this PR has no CI — and only the second of them means the wait is nearly over. The same
// distinction decides the queue rule server-side, where not-knowing never parks a thread.

// The merge verdict, appended to the counts. Two of GitHub's four states are SILENT here, for two
// different reasons:
//   • UNKNOWN — GitHub computes mergeability asynchronously and reports it while still thinking, so a
//     phrase for it would say "frizz has not heard back" in words that sound like a verdict.
//   • BLOCKED WHILE CI IS RED OR RUNNING — "blocked" is then just the checks restated, which is the
//     doubling this row exists to remove. It survives on a GREEN PR, where it is the one thing the
//     counts do not say: CI is done and something else (a review, a required branch) still holds it.

// resting card while the thread is at rest on it, the fence card whenever it is not — mid-turn on a
// follow-up the human typed while the worker was still working, or after a wake, until the worker rests
// again. The fence card used to print the fence's machinery there instead, one muted line of
// runtime ids ("shell b7w140a81   for 45m"), and the maintainer kept meeting it on SHELL waits precisely
// because a shell wait is the one that resumes mid-turn — a PR fence at least carried its ref as a link
// (2026-08-27: "for shells, I keep on seeing this fucking disgusting thing … I feel like we've had many
// other times where I see it render a shell waiter much nicer than this").
//
// THE FENCE'S OWN `shells:` ARE ROWED HERE, off `hints`, and not only off `thread.watches`. The board
// synthesizes a shell row from the fence only while that fence is the worker's last word
// (board.fenceWatchViews reads `tele.lastFence`, and the tailer clears it on the very user record that
// bumps the thread) — so the day this table moved onto the fence card it was written believing the rows
// survived the bump, and they did not. A registered PR and an armed timer are rows in their own
// registries and outlived it; a shell the worker had only DECLARED vanished from the card the moment the
// human replied, while the shell kept running (maintainer 2026-08-28, with the screenshots: "it hides
// one of the rows, one of the three specifically. It hides the background shell for some reason"). A
// hint is resolved against the thread's live shells exactly as the board resolves it — a name matching
// nothing running is not a wait and gets no row — so the fence card cannot claim a shell that finished.
// (A `notAfter` instant cut the rows to what was live at a rest the thread had run past, for the card
// the transcript drew at that rest from 2026-08-28; no awaiting card is drawn while a thread runs since
// 2026-09-24, so the option went with it.)

          would each size their own name column and the statuses would step.

          THE STATUS TRACK IS CAPPED AT HALF THE GRID — `fit-content(50%)`, not `auto` — because the

          failures" measured the track at 271px on the 308px fullscreen rail and truncated every file
          name in the grid to its ellipsis (maintainer 2026-09-02, screenshot of a 22-file rail reading

 *  - NOT EVENT-SNOOZED. This one reverses a dated decision rather than extending it: the snooze was
 *    deliberately confined to the queue, because the drawer showing NOTHING at rest reads as "the agent

 *  two surfaces (maintainer 2026-07-25). What that reasoning missed is WHICH THREADS REACH THE QUEUE. A

 *  "Why is there no fucking snooze button?!?!?! There are very few cases where an awaiting block should
 *  lock a snooze button").
 *
 *  So the card carries its own verb instead of waiting to be handed one, and the fence can no longer
 *  take it away. The drawer does not blank on the click, which is what the original ruling was protecting
 *  (found 2026-07-29, "reads as if the agent died"): `showsRestingCard` goes false, and the awaiting
 *  FENCE card — suppressed only while this card shows — takes the slot and states the same wait compactly.
 *
 *  There is no card to fade: it took `onSnooze`/`onSnoozeFailed` for the project board's queue card,
