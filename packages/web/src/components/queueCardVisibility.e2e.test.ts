// A LONG QUEUE BUILDS AND LAYS OUT ONLY THE CARDS NEAR THE SCREEN (lib/cardVisibility.ts), against the
// real AllQueuesCard on queue-card-states-fixture.html?case=many — 60 cards, every third one long enough to
// clamp, only the network stubbed. What it pins:
//
//   1  before anything is idle, the cards on screen are built and drawn unclipped (`data-near`, so no
//      paint containment), and the cards far below are stand-ins — what took a 244-card load from one 7s
//      task to ~1.3s (2026-10-02);
//   2  left alone, every card gets built, and every far card is SKIPPED at exactly the height it really
//      has — a skipped card sized by a stale guess is a jump waiting for the reader to scroll to it;
//   3  a far card's clamp is measured once it is drawn, not at mount, and still clamps ("Show more");
//   4  a board delta re-renders NO card: every card's reply box and model strip used to read the board's
//      threads, so each delta re-rendered every card on the page;
//   5  a JUMP past the observer's margin (a scrollbar drag, End) paints real cards in its first frame, not
//      stand-ins — the observer reports a frame late, so the cards are built from the scroll event itself;
//   6  the card being read holds still when a card above it changes height in a frame that also scrolls —
//      the viewport lock re-took its anchor before undoing such a move, and cards building near the screen
//      made it common;
//   7  typing `@` into a card's reply box still offers the board's threads — the box subscribes to them only
//      once its draft holds an `@`, so this pins that the switch turns on;
//   8  after the column changes width, every skipped card is re-drawn at its new height — a width change
//      mutates nothing, and each skipped card kept the height it had at the old width — a few at a time;
//   9  cards moved on screen by a filter (no scroll, no mount) are real cards in the first frame, and cards
//      mounted again after it start at the height they were last drawn at, not the guess;
//  10  `k` landing on a card whose handoff is still loading presses its "Show more" once it appears;
//  11  a jump to the end before the page is built stays at the end — the cards it lands on and the cards
//      above them change height as they are built, and each change used to push the last card off screen;
//  12  so does the End KEY, a smooth scroll whose target the browser fixed before those cards were built, and
//      so does a jump made before the handoffs are fetched, whose cards grow when they land;
//  13  End takes the page's own glide while cards are unbuilt, having built the end of the page first — the
//      browser's End aims at the end the page had when it started, and in a headed browser it animates
//      past cards that build at their real height on the way (headless jumps at once, which test 12 cannot
//      tell apart, so this pins the handler itself).
//
// Skipped unless a Vite URL serving the fixtures is provided: `nub run test:e2e` sets it, or start
// `vite` in packages/web and set FRIZZ_QUEUE_CARD_VISIBILITY_E2E_URL to its origin.
