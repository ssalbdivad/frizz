// ON A PHONE THE TRANSCRIPT'S QUESTIONS ARE ANSWERED WHERE THEY STAND (2026-10-03). Each open registered
// question draws compactly — its number, its text, and each option as a full-width tap target carrying
// its letter, label and one-line trade-off. A plain single-choice question is answered by ONE TAP on its
// option: the pick goes through the thread's shared RegisteredAnswering, whose "a pick that completes its
// question sends it" rule is the send, exactly as a click on the desktop card is.
//
// Until 2026-10-03 these cards were READ-ONLY (mockup v2 §3) and every answer went through the stepped
// sheet behind the bottom bar's "Answer" — even a two-option yes/no, and nothing on the card said the
// sheet was where answering lived (maintainer: "it should be possible to answer simple questions without
// the expanded view, which isn't even clear that's how it's supposed to work"). The sheet
// (RegisteredAnswerSheet) stays for what one tap cannot finish, and the card opens it AT THAT QUESTION:
//   - an option with follow-ups: the tap records the pick, then the sheet opens on the first follow-up;
//   - an option with a rich (multi-line) body: the tap opens the sheet, where the body renders in full —
//     a pick made without reading the detail that decides it is the thing the body exists to prevent;
//   - "Other answer…" under a single-choice, and "Write an answer…" for a free-text question: typing
//     belongs in the sheet, whose footer rides the keyboard;
//   - a multi-select toggles here, and a Send under it commits that question alone.
//
// The accent is on the numbers and the RECOMMENDED tags and nowhere else (not a card border): the
// accent means "awaiting you", and on this card that is the question and the worker's own pick.
//
// PROVIDED, NOT DETECTED. The phone thread page (ChatView with `phone`) provides this context; every
// registered card under it reads it and draws compactly. Detecting the width inside the card instead
// would also compact the /full page on a narrow window, which keeps the desktop chrome — and its own
// per-card Send — on every width. `numberOf` numbers a question by its place among the thread's open
// questions, so a card placed inside a message and its sibling at the rest still count 1, 2. `openSheet`
// opens the answer sheet, at the step `stepKey` names or else where the human left off.
