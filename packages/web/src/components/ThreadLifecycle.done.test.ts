// button?"). The cluster now stays and STATES the state. These assertions pin both halves of that: the
// readout appears, and the verbs it replaces do not come back on a thread that cannot take them. The
// cluster was a footer strip under the prompt box until 2026-10-05; it closes the header's action
// strip now, as a bare alarm clock and a bare check.
