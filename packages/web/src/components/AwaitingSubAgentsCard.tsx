// A QUEUED PARENT'S SUB-AGENTS, ON ITS QUEUE CARD.
//
// A parent that fanned out several background sub-agents rests "awaiting" them, and each return wakes it:
// it reads the report and rests again. A rest that is not an honoured park queues (a partial return may
// give the human something to act on), so the queue meets that parent once per return. Everything's card
// drew it as a bare "Awaiting" fence over the worker's prose and a wall-clock Snooze, so nothing said
// which children were still out, which had come back, or why the card was back at all.
//
// This card is that fence, stated plainly (maintainer 2026-09-29):
//   • the heading counts the batch — "2 of 3 sub-agents returned" — rather than naming the state;
//   • the rows are the batch: the ones still out (QueueSubAgentLines, the rows the project board's
//     queue card drew under its prompt box until 2026-09-28) and the ones that came back since the wait
//     opened, with the muted check Colin's focus-mode mockup (4d7b3cb8) drew them with;
//   • the band carries the two EVENT snoozes. "Until all return" waits out the batch — each return still
//     wakes the agent, only the last one brings the card back (board.subAgentsSnoozeHolds). "Until new
//     activity" is the drawer's resting-card snooze (AwaitingBackgroundCard), spent by the next rest.
//     The footer's snooze menu offers the same two (SubAgentWaitSnoozeItems) beside its wall clock.
//
// It is its own component, mounted by AllQueuesCard in place of the fence it replaces, because that card
// is edited by several hands at once and this one only needs a line there.
