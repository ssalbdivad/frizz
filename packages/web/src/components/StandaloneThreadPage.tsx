        {/* THE FULLSCREEN LAYOUT (maintainer 2026-08-28, second pass): the thread column and the
            rail sit together as ONE CENTERED PAIR — "the combination of the agent pane and the
            artifact readout should be centered on the page, and there should be some reasonable
            maximum width on the agent pane" — with the file viewer sliding in over the rail when a
            file opens (see SidePane). The column's ceiling is the DRAWER's own width
            (lib/sheet.ts SHEET_BASE_WIDTH; maintainer 2026-08-31: "the same width as the regular
            drawer width" — an earlier 960px "still lets the chat go too wide").

            NOTHING HERE IS SIZED BY WHAT IS BESIDE IT (maintainer 2026-09-01: "you should not be
            resizing the chat transcript column … you also should never resize the code panes that
            slide in. Otherwise, it's going to be re-flowing in a way that just takes unnecessary
            CPU"). Both columns are pure functions of the PAGE width — see LAYOUT_VARS — so opening
            or closing a file changes no width anywhere and neither the transcript nor the file
            re-wraps. What moves is the ROW, by one transform, from centered to hard left; a
            transform is composited, so the whole open costs no layout at all. The flex-grow /
            flex-basis / width transitions this replaced re-laid out both columns' contents on every
            frame of the 200ms.

            The GUTTER is that centering spelled out rather than left to `flex-1` — exactly the slack
            beside the pair, so translating the row by −gutter puts the thread column hard against the
            left edge and the pane against the right. The pane is ALREADY full width while it is
            closed (the rail sits at its left and the remainder hangs off the page, clipped by the
            frame around the row), which is what lets its width be a constant.

            A window NARROWER THAN THE SPLIT gets one column — the rail and the viewer need the width
            they hide under, so below SPLIT_MIN_PX the thread column takes the page under its 720 cap,
            which is exactly the drawer's width. */}
