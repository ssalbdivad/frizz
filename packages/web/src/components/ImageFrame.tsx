// THE frame every rendered image sits in — a lightbox gallery, a path the agent wrote on its own line, a
// file the human attached. One element so they cannot drift: an outer border in the tool-card family, a
// little inset padding (the mat), and the picture centered inside it.
// A screenshot a TOOL returned sits in the same mat inside its own collapsed card (ChatView
// ToolImageCard), whose border is the frame's, so opening it draws one framed object rather than a
// bordered card with a separately bordered picture nested in it. A SendUserFile delivery's gallery does
// the same inside its card (SentFilesCard, LightboxGallery `framed={false}`).
//
// The frame SPANS the message width and centers the picture inside the mat, rather than shrink-wrapping
// it. Shrink-wrapping was tried first and is what "consistent frame" rules out: two image Reads in one
// turn measured 323px and 678px wide, so a column of screenshots painted a ragged stack of boxes with no
// shared edge — while every other tool card in the transcript runs full width. A spanning frame puts them
// all on the same left and right rules, which is the whole point of having one element.
//
// The mat is `--color-panel-2`, a step LIGHTER than the card background, and it is doing real work rather
// than decoration: agent screenshots are overwhelmingly dark UI, so on the page background their own edges
// vanish and the picture bleeds into its frame. The lighter mat gives every shot a visible boundary
// without nesting a second border 6px inside the first.
//
// `frizz-bash` supplies the chrome AND the typography of the tool-card family (1px border, block radius,
// mono 12.5px). Carrying the class rather than re-declaring those in Tailwind keeps a framed picture in
// the same family as the Bash / Read / Edit cards around it, and its caption in their type.

// The frame's two boxes as bare class strings, because the OTHER surface that has to draw this frame
// cannot render a component: a Markdown `![](…)` is sanitized into an HTML STRING (lib/markdown.ts),
// never into React. It mints the same two boxes around its `<img>` from these exact constants, so the
// framed picture a worker writes as Markdown and the one it delivers as a bare path are the same object
// rather than two lookalikes that drift apart on the next change here.
