// The readout has two halves that are easy to break in opposite directions, so both are pinned here.

// ABSENCE must cost nothing. The server omits `context` entirely unless it has BOTH halves of the
// fraction, and the client's contract is that an absent reading renders zero bytes — no 0% dial, no empty
// ring, no "—". A regression here is invisible in review and immediately visible in the product, because
// every Claude thread is in exactly that state until its first turn ends.
//
// PRESENCE is ONE reading, "74% context", in the header line beside "Last active" — the percent on the
// surface, the token counts in the hover/screen-reader label. (In the lifecycle footer, before
// 2026-10-05, the dial stood alone with no words; the header line is made of words, so the reading
// joined it as one.) And "thinner" must not become "smaller": the stroke was thinned from 3 to 2 with r
// raised to compensate, so the OUTER edge is still 7.5 units.
