// highlighted source. Every link to one lands here instead of launching the desktop opener — a worker
// citing `AGENTS.md`, a backticked path that resolved to a file, an attached log — because throwing
// the user out of Frizz into an editor to read two paragraphs is the wrong answer to "what does that
// file say?". It was Markdown-only until 2026-09-28, when every file the page can show at all came
// in-app (lib/localViewer.ts decides which).
//
// A Markdown file's own directory is passed as the render base, so its RELATIVE links
// (`./ARCHITECTURE.md`, `docs/x.md`, an image beside it) resolve to real paths — a doc that
// cross-references its neighbours is browsable, each link stacking another reader over this one.
// Content is a file on disk written by whoever wrote it, so it goes through the same allowlist
// sanitizer as every other prose surface.

// which goes to the OS's own viewer, as an image click always did: an editor is no place to look at a
// screenshot. Exported because the /full page's split FileViewerPanel and the picture viewer are the
// same escape in different frames and must not fork this. `onOpen` runs first — the picture viewer
