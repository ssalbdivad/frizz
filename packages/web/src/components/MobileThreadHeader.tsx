// THE PHONE THREAD HEADER (mockup v2 §2). The desktop drawer's header is two rows — title and "Last
// active", then an icon strip and a bordered × — and at 390pt it spent 91.5px on controls a phone either
// cannot use (copy a terminal command, open fullscreen) or reaches more easily from a list. This is one
// 56px row: ← back, the title, a subtitle that says where the thread stands, and ⋯ for everything else.
//
// ← IS THE PLATFORM'S BACK. When the app pushed the thread's history entry (it was opened from the
// board, or anywhere else in this session) it pops that entry — `history.back()` — and the router's
// popstate unwinds the drawer exactly as the browser's own Back or Android's edge swipe would. Reusing
// the desktop ×'s close here instead REPLACED the thread's entry with the board, which left two board
// entries in a row, so the next Back did nothing visible. Only a thread that arrived by a cold link (the
// entry the document loaded on — nothing of ours below it) closes the ×'s way and lands on the board.
// See `appPushedCurrentEntry` in lib/router.
//
// It does NOT take the drawer's initial focus the way × did (`data-dialog-initial-focus`): a
// programmatically focused button matches :focus-visible, so the page opened with a lit circle around ←.
// Focus falls back to the sheet itself, which draws nothing.
//
// The subtitle leads with the STATE because that is what a phone reader opens a thread to learn:
// "Needs you" in the accent (the one thing the accent is for), "Working" in the live green while a turn
// runs, otherwise "Rested" — then the age, then the model and effort. See lib/mobileThread.ts.
//
// Everything the icon strip and the lifecycle footer held — Snooze, Goal, the registered files, Rename,
// Copy link, and Retry / Restart worker / Reload plugins where the header offers them — is in the ⋯
// sheet (ThreadActionsSheet).
