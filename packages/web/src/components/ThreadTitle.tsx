// THE THREAD'S NAME, AND BOTH WAYS OF CHANGING IT — click the name to type a new one, or point at it
// and press the refresh mark to have Claude re-derive one. Rendered by the thread header (ChatView),
// and by the project board's queue card header (TodosView) from this ONE component until that board
// went on 2026-09-28, so the two surfaces could not drift. The cross-project card (AllQueuesCard)
// does NOT render it — its title is a link that opens the drawer — so the queue has no rename in place
// today, which is the asymmetry below come back. They drifted once before: the queue card carried only
// the refresh mark until 2026-09-13 — its title was a plain div, on the theory that the queue is a
// triage surface and a manual rename belongs in the drawer — and the maintainer met the asymmetry on
// the first card they wanted to retitle ("It only lets me rename. I should be able to click on it to
// retitle it.").
//
// The editor is the title's OWN box: the name is a button, the click swaps in an input seeded with
// the current title (never the slug or a placeholder — lib/threadTitle.ts), Enter or blur commits,
// Escape cancels. Empty and unchanged commits are no-ops, so a stray click cannot erase a good name.
//
// Foreign rows and legacy docs have no registry row to rename, so the name is plain text there; the
// refresh mark makes its own call (AiRenameButton) and hides while the editor is open.
