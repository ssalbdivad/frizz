// THE REPEAT GLYPH on a thread that a SCHEDULE started, or will start (plans/scheduled-threads.md §8): its
// pending next run, a lazy row in Snoozed, and every run it has started. One small mark after the title —
// the rail's rows are their titles and nothing else (Sidebar.tsx ThreadRow), so the schedule is a glyph with
// a tooltip, never a chip — saying "this came from a schedule", with the schedule and its rule one hover
// away: "From Triage issues · every Monday at 9am".
//
// lucide's `Repeat`, CROPPED TO ITS INK like the ACP plug (ProviderMark.tsx AcpMark): its paths span x 3–21
// and y 2–22 of the 24-unit box, plus half the 2.5 stroke a side, so the viewBox below is the ink box and the
// caller's `ml-1` is 4px of ink gap, the same gap the provider mark keeps beside it. Stroke 2.5, not lucide's
// 2: at a 10px box the default pen draws 0.9px lines, which read as a fainter mark than the filled provider
// glyph next to it.
//
// VERTICALLY the box IS the ink, and an inline box with no text in it sits its bottom edge on the title's
// baseline, so `translate-y-[calc(H/2 - 0.5cap)]` puts the ink's centre on the cap band's in any font at
// any size — the browser computes it, nothing to re-measure when the type moves. Measured on the real rows
// (visual-review cap-band probe, sans = system-ui, dsf 2; ink centre minus cap-band centre, + = low):
// a flat `translate-y-px` (the provider marks' nudge) read +0.77px on the 13px row and +0.76px on the 15px
// semibold card title; untranslated it is -0.23px; with the cap term, 0.00 on both. The Claude asterisk
// beside it reads +0.27px on the same probe, and is left alone.
//
// HORIZONTALLY, ink to ink (geometry plus the 2.5 stroke's half): title → mark 3.52px on the row, against
// 3.64px from a title straight to its provider mark; mark → Claude asterisk 4.00px. 4.97px after the
// card's 15px title (`ml-1.5`).
