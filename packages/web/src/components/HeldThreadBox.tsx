// A HELD THREAD's prompt box (ThreadView.held): a thread written down with no agent behind it. Its text IS
// the box's text — there is no separate note view to keep in step with a draft — so the queue card and the
// drawer show the same words, edits save back as they are typed, and sending it starts the agent with
// whatever the box says by then.
//
// It is not ThreadComposerBox, on purpose. Everything that box carries is about a RUNNING agent — its model
// and permission controls act on a live runtime, `/` asks the harness for its skills, ⌘-Enter interrupts a
// turn, `$ cmd` opens a terminal in the agent's folder — and a held thread has none of those yet. The
// profile it starts on is the one the prompt box had when it was written down.
//
// The draft store is not used either: the server keeps the text (ThreadView.heldPrompt), so the box reads it
// from the board and writes it back through updateHeldPrompt. `saved` is the last text this box knows the
// server has, which is how a board push of our own save is told apart from an edit made somewhere else (the
// other surface, another tab).
