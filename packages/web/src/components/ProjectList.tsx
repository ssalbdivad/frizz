// THE PROJECT LIST — the page's left column under the prompt box: the VIEW's projects (lib/pageView.ts) —
// the one project the page is focused on, or every project on the machine — each with its work in flight
// listed under its name, and the rest of it one click away, in place.
//
// It is the project view's rail, folded into the one page (maintainer 2026-09-28: "does there need to be a
// project specific view at all or can we do enough with the main project view to just focus on what
// people are currently working on and make things expandable?", and then "ensure detailed drill down like
// `done` or other statuses for each project is still visible somehow just deemphasize it creatively all
// functionality must still be available without a project-specific view"). So every band that rail had is
// here, for each project, at two volumes:
//
//   LOUD  — Pinned, Ready and Working: the work in flight, listed under its project unless it is folded,
//           with no name over any of them. Colin's sidebar named all three ("sidebar labels for pinned,
//           queue, and running … should not be collapsible"); here each row says its band itself — a pin,
//           a rest time, a spinner — so the names were dropped (maintainer 2026-09-29).
//   QUIET — Snoozed, Done and External: a muted count per band under the work in flight, in the band's own
//           glyph (the rail's legend, BandLabel.tsx), never louder than the names. Each count is its own
//           toggle on the project's row, collapsed to start (Colin's sidebar had the same three as
//           separate collapsible sections), and an open band lists its rows under the work in flight,
//           with no name or caret of its own (maintainer 2026-10-01, of a caret row closing every project:
//           "find some way to have it expand just from the title bar so we don't need anything at the
//           bottom of the list"). The same day the counts alone proved too hidden ("the click done on the
//           top being the only way to view is too confusing"), so an unfolded project also says "N more" in
//           words, which lists the rest in place (MoreToggle) — one unnamed affordance, not a caret per
//           band. It ENDED the project's list, on a row of its own, until 2026-10-06; it now sits on the
//           project's own line beside its name, because that row cost every project a line, and at
//           Colin's load (17 projects, 70 open threads) the project frames ate a third of the screen —
//           see ProjectGroup.
//
// ONE PRESENTATION, BOTH VIEWS. Focus mode is this list with one project in it; All projects is the same
// groups, one per project. So the density is what a busy project costs beyond its own rows, and it is
// measured, not guessed — see the header of ProjectGroup.
//
// And the row itself FOLDS its project: one click and everything under it goes, work in flight included,
// so the list shows only the projects being looked at (lib/crossProject.ts has the folds).
//
// EVERY ROW IS ITS PROJECT'S. The page project is only what the page is bound to — showing All projects,
// the prompt box's pick, which is usually another project — so each group sits in a ThreadProjectScope: pin, reopen, Retry and a sub-agent's × go through the row's
// own project's client, and a click opens its card or its drawer in place (RowScope). The row itself is
// the rail's (Sidebar.tsx RailRow) — the same anatomy, hover strip and marks the project view drew,
// measured once, not a second copy of them.
//
// AND THE PROJECTS DRAG. A project's row is its grip: press, travel a few pixels, and the whole group —
// row and threads — lifts and follows the pointer while the groups it passes slide aside; drop it and the
// machine-wide order is rewritten (`projectsReorder`), so every surface that reads it moves as one.
// A drag stays inside its run — the busy projects, or the quiet ones under them — because busy-ness, not
// the order, decides which run a project is in: a busy project dropped among the quiet ones would
// only jump back. Alt+Arrow on a focused row moves it one place, for anyone not using a mouse.

 * Measured on a seeded stack (sans, Colin's load: 17 projects, 70 open threads; the planning thread's
 * sidebar/seed-scale.ts, gated by capacityParity.e2e.test.ts):
 *
 *   the project's row          23px  (27 until 2026-09-29: 2px of padding a side, not 4 — the 16px square
 *                                     still has 3.5px around it, and nothing wraps in it)
 *   a band's name, per band     0px  (none since 2026-10-01: the count on the project's row is its only
 *                                     handle; 15px before, and Colin's was a 23.7px header under a 25px rule)
 *   "N more"                    0px  (on the project's row since 2026-10-06, MoreToggle; a 23px row of its
 *                                     own under the threads from 2026-10-01)
 *   the space before the next   6px  (GROUP_GAP; a 13px gap with a hairline in it 2026-10-01 to 10-06)
 *
 * so a busy project costs 23 + 6 = 29px beyond its rows — about one thread row (27.5px) — measured 28.3px
 * a project across Colin's load, against 55px with the "N more" row and the rule (59 by the table). That
 * is the difference between 17 lines and 23 on a 1440x900 screen, and 22 and 29 on a 1920x1080 one,
 * where upstream's board, one project, shows 22 / 28. Earlier: 59px while both loud bands
 * were named, 80 while the quiet counts sat on a 21px line of their own (2026-09-29 only), 66 before the
 * bands had names — and the same project in Colin's sidebar, one project per page, cost 267px for its six
 * headers and five rules.
 *
 * Its FOCUS project (the page project, whose board is live in the store) reads the rest from that board;
 * every other reads its board through the cache, which the list read ahead.

 * under its row — its work in flight and, if any is open, the rest — and a second click brings it all
 * back; each quiet band opens from its own count on the row (QuietToggles). Unfolding a project with nothing Ready opens the rest too (maintainer 2026-10-01: "if a project has
 * nothing ready, clicking expand should probably expand done/snoozed etc. as well") — its work in flight is
 * all it would show, and none of it wants you. A quiet project has nothing under it but the rest, so its
 * click opens every quiet band it has, and folds them away again.
 * Nothing navigates. The whole row is the fold's target; only its own controls sit above it.
 *
 * BESIDE ITS NAME, "N more" (MoreToggle) while its list is showing — the rest of the project, said in words
 * on the line the project already spends, rather than on a row of its own under its threads.

 * ON HOVER, WHAT UPSTREAM'S PROJECT CARD SAID (U:ProjectGrid.tsx, the grid the fork's home replaced): its
 * folder, its `/slug` when that is not just its name, and when it was last opened — or that its directory
 * is missing. A tooltip over the whole row, with the fold it performs on the last line, and the same facts
 * head its "…" menu (ProjectActions.tsx ProjectMenu). A row is one line of 13px type and has no room for
 * three more; the card's facts are reference, read when wanted, never chrome on a busy list.
 *
 * Its right edge carries, in order: the quiet bands' counts — each ITS OWN toggle, always here, folded or
 * not, so opening one never moves the rest (maintainer 2026-09-29, reversing a morning's move of them under
 * the threads: "don't move the done/snooze/external buttons when expanding just always leave them at the
 * top") — then its Ready count: the accent
 * badge, the one number in the list that wants you, which stays when the project is folded so a folded
 * project still says it is waiting. Or, in their place, a note, only when something is wrong: its directory
 * is gone, or this server has not opened it. On hover the badge gives way to the "…" (ProjectActions.tsx
 * ProjectMenu): the page's view, its repo, its icon, rename and delete. The badge's slot is held even when
 * empty, so the counts never slide under the menu.

 * Quieter than the name and never the accent, which in this product means only "this many want you".
 *
 * A FOLDED project counts its work in flight the same way, first: its Pinned rows by the pin, then its
 * Running rows by the bot (David 2026-09-29: "when collapsed ... it should also show the number of
 * running/ready threads"); its Queue rows are the accent badge beside these, which already stays through
 * a fold, so they are not counted twice. Pinned joined them on 2026-10-06 — every thread belongs to one of
 * five rails and that status must never leave view (Colin's S1, plans/upstream-superset.md §1), and a fold
 * that hid a project's pins said nothing at all of them.
 *
 * EACH COUNT IS ITS OWN TOGGLE — Snoozed, Done and External open and close one at a time, all collapsed to
 * start. An open one is a step brighter, and its band lists under the project's threads, named. On a folded
 * project a click unfolds it too, so it always shows what it says; the Pinned and Running counts only unfold. Each
 * wash hangs 4px past its count's ink (`-mx-1 px-1`), so the ink stays exactly where it sat before the
 * counts were buttons; `relative`, to sit above the fold's whole-row target.
