// A PROJECT'S BOARD — the page's left column at `/project/<slug>` (lib/pageView.ts): one project's threads,
// banded and NAMED as Colin's sidebar named them (upstream colinhacks/frizz 0a3b9139 Sidebar.tsx), top to
// bottom:
//
//   PINNED    the human's shelf, oldest pin first, whatever each thread's state — a Done one greyed.
//             Only when it has rows.
//   QUEUE     the threads at rest, in the queue's order — exactly the cards in the middle column, each
//             row with its rest time.
//   ─────     a rule, when Running follows
//   RUNNING   the ones spinning, by recency — no rest time: a row that is still working made no handoff.
//   ─────
//   ▸ SNOOZED     collapsed to start, each a header that opens its rows in place
//   ▸ DONE        (virtualized once open: the one band that grows without bound)
//   ▸ EXTERNAL    the project's own `claude`/`codex` terminals, which Frizz reads but does not drive
//   ▸ SCHEDULES   the project's schedules
//
// Pinned, Queue and Running are never collapsible (upstream 2026-09-19: the Pinned, Queue and Running
// labels "should not be collapsible") — you cannot hide your queue or your live work — so their headers
// are static and nothing on the board folds them. The vocabulary is ARCHITECTURE.md § Board nomenclature:
// Queue is the maintainer's Rested (the cue), Running his Active.
//
// WHY IT CAME BACK (2026-10-06, plans/upstream-superset.md §2). From 2026-09-29 a project's page was All
// projects' list with one project in it — its row's counts and its threads under no name, the quiet
// bands opened from counts on that row. David took the fork as the base with Colin's board in it, so a
// project's own page reads as Colin built it again; All projects keeps its own compact list
// (ProjectList.tsx), which is this board's job one level up.
//
// WHAT IS THE FORK'S, kept on purpose: the row (Sidebar.tsx RailRow — the indicator, the rest time, the
// pin mark, a schedule's mark, the reading marker, the hover verbs), every row's click (its card when the
// queue is showing it, else its drawer, in place — useRowScope), the list held still under the pointer
// (lib/listHold.ts, lib/heldLayout.ts), the operator's own acts moving rows before the server answers
// (lib/listBands.ts listOverlay), and the cord that strings the project's rows through their glyphs
// (ThreadConnector.tsx — a band's header glyph stands in the same column, so the names cost it nothing).
// No project row heads the board: the switcher over the prompt box names the project (StatusRow.tsx), so
// a row repeating it would only cost the board a line — and the capacity gate has none to spare
// (capacityParity.e2e.test.ts).
