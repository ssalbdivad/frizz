// The Goal panel batches: nothing writes until the panel is LEFT (2026-09-02 — dismissal is the save
// gesture; the 2026-08-31 Save button is gone, but the batching it bought stays, because checking a
// trigger before that used to arm it instantly and the stop hook bumped the thread before the operator
// finished configuring). The draft is read at instants that never blur the minutes field — Enter in the
// textarea saves, Escape saves after tearing the input out of the DOM — so the draft resolves the
// cadence from the STRING the operator can see rather than from the last committed number, and this
// pins that resolution: it is where the original bug lived (type 55 over a 25-minute schedule, press
