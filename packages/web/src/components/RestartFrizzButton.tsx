// The one anchor both panels that hang off this button use. Desktop: anchored to the button's LEFT
// edge and opening RIGHTWARD, into the gutter and the workpane beyond it. The button sits at the
// right end of the status row above the prompt box, so there is always a workpane's width to its
// right and never enough room to its left for a 23rem panel — a right-0 anchor pushed it off-screen
// back when this control was corner chrome, and would still push it across the sidebar now. z-50 is
// a ROOT-level z now: the status row is loose on the page and carries no stacking context of its own
// (it was a z-20 chip until 2026-08-19), and the sidebar deliberately has no z-index, so z-50 is what
// puts either panel over the rail and the composer.
//
// Below `sm:` (640px) the panel is the `fixed left-3 right-3 top-12` full-width strip instead. The phone
// shell (700px) never shows it, but an editor's sidebar does: VS Code's renders this desktop shell 300-
// 600px wide with the status row at the top, so the strip hangs just under the button (48px against a
// 36px bottom, at 300 and 450). The strip draws NO arrow — see PANEL_ARROW.
// The phone's update lives on its Settings page (MobileUpdateRow in SettingsDrawer.tsx), and its failure
// card renders inline there (`mobile`), not off this anchor.
//
// `sm:-left-[17px]` is DERIVED from the arrow, not chosen: PANEL_ARROW below carries the arithmetic
// and the readings. It is not the offset that lines the panel's own edge up with anything — the panel
// hangs 11px further left than the button's box, which is what it costs to put the arrow's base on a
// straight run of border while its apex stays on the mark.

// ONE arrow for both panels; only the border tone differs. Every number is measured, and the two that
// look arbitrary are the two the old spelling (`-top-1.5 left-1.5`) got wrong — it drew the left foot
// 4.51px from the panel's edge, 7.5px INSIDE the card's own 12px corner arc, so the tent grew straight
// out of the curve with no flat border to its left and the corner read as bent (maintainer, 2026-08-26).
//
// `left-4`: a 12px square rotated 45° spans 16.97px, so its feet sit 8.49px either side of the apex.
//   An absolute offset is measured from the PADDING edge, 1px inside the border, so the left foot lands
//   1 + 16 - 8.49 = 14.51px from the panel's left edge and clears the `rounded-xl` 12px arc by 2.5px.
// `-top-[7px]`: 1px border + 6px half-square puts the square's CENTRE on the panel's border-box top, so
//   the base diagonal lies along the top border and the arrow's own fill covers it. `-top-1.5` sat that
//   centre 1px lower, leaving 1px of border painted across the base as a notch at each foot.
// `sm:-left-[17px]` follows: the apex is at panelLeft + 1 + 16 + 6, and the mark it points at is the
//   button's 12px glyph centre, 6px into the wrapper that STATUS_ROW_ACTION's `-mx-1.5` ink trim
//   (lib/statusRow.ts) leaves behind — so panelLeft = 6 - 23 = -17.
//
// Below `sm:` it is `hidden`: the strip's arrow sat at its left (x 35) under nothing, with the button at
//   the frame's right end, and no arrow can reach that button there. Its glyph centre is 18px from the
//   frame's right edge; the strip's right edge is 12px inside it, and the arrow's right foot needs the
//   same 14.51px off that corner as the left one, so its apex can come no nearer than 35px from the edge.
//
// RE-DERIVE, don't re-guess, if the corner radius, the arrow size, the panel border or that ink trim
// moves. `nub scripts/shot.mjs http://localhost:<vite>/restart-frizz-button-fixture.html?failure
// out.png --clip=.rotate-45 --pad=18 --dsf=8` is the crop that shows the join.
