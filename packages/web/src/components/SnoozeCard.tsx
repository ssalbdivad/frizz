// THE SNOOZE, STATED WHERE THE TRANSCRIPT ENDS. A wall-clock snooze (`snoozedUntil`) was legible only
// on hover — the rail hourglass's popover, the footer's presence glyph, the Wake button's title — so an
// opened thread said nothing about WHY it was parked in Snoozed or when it would come back (maintainer
// 2026-08-24: "it doesn't say that it's been snoozed. It doesn't say when the snooze expires"). This
// card sits at the bottom of the transcript, in the same runtime-status slot as the resting card, and
// it reads as a COUNTDOWN (same maintainer, same day): the remaining time is the headline, ticking
// live, with the wake instant and the one useful verb under it.
//
// It renders whenever the thread carries a FUTURE snooze, and it loses the slot to every harder state
// above it in ChatView's chain (a provider fault, a limit pause, a pending ask, a permission prompt,
// the working indicator) — a snooze on a running thread has not taken effect yet, and a snoozed thread
// holding an answerable question should show the question. It WINS the slot over the resting card: once
// the human has parked the thread, "awaiting background work" is not the state the park is about
// (same rule showsRestingCard already applies to the event-snooze).
