// carries its own mark) and the shared right-hand meta slot — so it is the only one that can render the
// same fact twice. It shipped doing exactly that: a live child read "running 3 min ●" AND "● running",
// and a quiet child read the self-contradicting "stale ●running". Pin both halves of that rule here:
// a resolved child owns the row's status alone, and a dispatch with NO child record must still surface
// its terminal status/duration through the meta slot (the suppression must never eat that).
//
// Since 2026-07-29 this also pins the row's SHAPE, which now mirrors the sub-agent lines under the
// prompt box: the liveness MARK first, then the petite-caps "Agent", then the title, then the READING
// right-justified at the far edge, then the chevron. The four facts that shape asserts — order, no RAW
// `frizz:` slug or bracketed tag, one flush right-hand column, and no EMPTY mark slot once the child
// has resolved — are each a thing the header used to get wrong.
