// THE PROJECT RAIL — every project on this machine as one icon square, always on screen.
//
// Slack's and Discord's rail, and for their reason: once a person is working across a dozen
// workspaces, "which one am I in" and "take me to another" are constant questions, and a home page
// answers neither without a round trip. Frizz reached the same point when one server started serving
// every project — upstream's project grid at `/` (this fork's All projects, `/all`) is a fine front door
// and a poor switcher.
//
// It is FIXED to the viewport's left edge, outside App's centered sidebar+workpane pair, so it holds
// still while the page scrolls and never enters the measure of anything else. App reserves its width
// with a padding-left on the container rather than a margin on the pair, so the pair still centers in
// whatever space is left.
//
// HIDDEN BELOW 800px, where the sidebar already stacks above the workpane and a permanent 56px column
// would be a tenth of the viewport spent on navigation. The switcher is the way there (a phone's own
// projects list, at `/`).

/**
 * The column's total painted width, and the inset every surface beside it reserves.
 *
 * 57 and not 56 because the rail is border-box and carries a 1px right border: at 56 the CONTENT box
 * is 55, and a 40px square centred in 55 sits half a pixel left of centre — measured at 7.5px on the
 * left against 8.5px on the right. 57 gives it a 56px content box and a true 8/8.
 *
 * Exported as a pair so the reserved space and the painted width cannot drift apart.

 * motion. It is drawn in the BADGE'S OWN ink (accent), not the spinner's muted grey, so the ring and the
 * disc read as one object (the maintainer's pick from a round of gap/weight mockups, 2026-09-24).
 *
 * GEOMETRY, and why every number is built the way it is. The ask was a 1.5px gap between the yellow
 * face and a 1.25px ring (maintainer, 2026-09-24: "a 1.5 px gap"; it was 2.25px nominal). Chrome
 * PAINTS BOX EDGES ON WHOLE CSS PIXELS at every device scale — a background box at x 35.25 painted at
 * 35, one at 36.5 at 37, measured at dsf 2 and 8 alike — so a half-pixel gap cannot be built from boxes;
 * the first attempt measured 1px on one side and 2px on the other. Two things DO keep their fractions,
 * and the ring is built from exactly those:
 *
 *   • the GAP is the badge's own 1px page-coloured cut-out plus a 0.5px page-coloured box-shadow
 *     (`RUNNING_GAP_SHADOW`, applied to the badge while this ring is shown). A shadow's spread is
 *     painted in floating point and follows the badge's shape, pill included.
 *   • the RING is a conic disc on a whole-pixel box 2px outside the badge (20px for one digit), SCALED
 *     to 0.975 — 19.5px — because a transform is not snapped either. The badge and its shadow sit on top
 *     and cover everything but the outer 1.25px. A pill's sides come out ~0.08px lighter than its ends
 *     (the scale is uniform), which is below anything a screen shows.
 *
 * Measured on the rendered pixels, dsf 2 and 8: gap 1.5 on all four sides, ring 1.25, centres coincident
 * — against a control shifted 0.5px that reads 0.5. The instrument is
 * .frizz/threads/39de55d9-73a0-434a-badd-16b69b24f748/measure-badge-ring.mjs.
 *
 * THE RING IS CSS, NOT SVG. It shipped as an <svg> inset half a stroke, and its ink sat 0.375px right
 * of and below the badge (maintainer: "your circles aren't concentric") because Chrome pixel-snaps an
 * SVG root's content box. Nor a MASK: the band was once cut with `mask: … content-box exclude`, and on a
 * quarter-pixel box Chrome painted that exclusion with a square top-left corner, erasing the ring there.
 * See `.frizz-rail-badge-ring` in styles.css.
