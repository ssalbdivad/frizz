// THE LEFT SIDEBAR — the thread list as a FLOATING column (no border, no fill: it floats in the
// page's whitespace the way the old ToC nav did). App centers the sidebar + workpane as a PAIR with
// a scaling gutter between them; this column is VERTICALLY CENTERED in the viewport and holds still
// while the workpane scrolls. Width SCALES with the viewport — clamp(272px, 34vw, 680px) — so titles
// get real room on large screens (titles WRAP, never truncate; captions stay one line; NEVER a
// horizontal scrollbar — overflow-x is clipped and unbreakable tokens break).
//
// ENTIRELY MOUSE-DRIVEN: no arrow-walk, no selection chevron. A session row CLICK opens the thread's
// drawer (chat / doc via store.openThread); a legacy row opens its frizz doc.
//
// Sections: FOUR bands top→bottom, in the names ARCHITECTURE.md § Board nomenclature fixes — RESTED
// (everything at rest = the queue's own rows, a.k.a. the cue), ACTIVE (the rows currently spinning),
// then a labeled DIMMED HELD band (every declared clock/hourglass/timed wait), then DONE — each split
// by a bare <hr>, and Snoozed and Done both collapsible. Rested and Active are ONE uncollapsible <section>
// (you can't hide your queue or your live work); the <hr> between them is the whole distinction, so
// never describe a rested row as active. A thread merely awaiting its OWN sub-agents is INTERNAL work
// and stays spinning in Active undimmed; only external waiters drop into the dimmed band (groups.ts
// isSnoozed).
// Needs-you renders as the row INDICATOR + the queue; awaiting as the hint gloss.
// Done = explicitly completed. Legacy .frizz rows do not render at all.
//
// Below those four, and outside the vocabulary entirely, sits EXTERNAL — the project's own
// `claude`/`codex` terminals. They are not a fifth band of frizz's model, they are a separate listing
// of work frizz can read but does not drive, so nothing about the four names above applies to them.

// A row's hover-revealed icon action: sized to the title's FIRST line (h-[19px]; the group's top-1
// matches the row's pt-1) so it never exceeds the row height. Bare glyphs — the group draws no box
// around them (its backing is the rail's own base colour under the row's hover wash; see the strip in
// ThreadRow), and only the one under the pointer paints its own square.
// OPAQUE PAINT, TRANSLUCENT BOX — `text-muted opacity-70`, never `text-muted-70`. The unpin is a lucide
// glyph FILLED and STROKED in currentColor, and an SVG paints the stroke over the fill: with an alpha
// colour the ring lands at ~0.8 alpha where it overlaps the 0.7 fill, so the pin read as a darker
// outline around a lighter middle (maintainer 2026-09-11: "slightly dimmer in the middle. It looks
// insane"). Group opacity composites the finished glyph once, so fill and stroke read as one solid
// body. Identical for the stroke-only door and Retry; `disabled:opacity-50` still wins, as a variant
// utility over a bare one.

              Only the cue's rows carry the rest-time column: it dates a HANDOFF, and a row that is

// THE DONE BAND, VIRTUALIZED — the only band that is, because it is the only one that grows without
// bound. Done holds every thread the human has ever finished, and it mounted all of them: 553 rows on a
// copy of the maintainer's own board, measured 2026-09-04 with scripts/verify-done-band-virtualization.mjs.
//
//   rail DOM nodes                     154 collapsed → 15,085 expanded
//   ONE full style recalculation      3.10ms         →  21.50ms   (6.9×)
//   ONE overlay open: main thread blocked   0ms      → 101-108ms, and 53ms → 119ms to paint
//
// Virtualized, expanded: 884 nodes, a 4.00ms recalculation, and no long task at all.
//
// The recalculation is the MECHANISM, not a side reading. App's body scroll lock (App.tsx) forces
// exactly one every time a drawer, the palette or the settings pane opens, so an expanded Done band
// taxes every later navigation whether or not the reader is looking at it — and the rows it taxes you
// for are the ones you finished with. The rows are ALREADY memoized; this was never a render problem.
//
// It shares the RAIL's scroller rather than growing a nested one — a second scrollbar inside the rail
// would be a UI change, and this is a performance fix. That is what `scrollMargin` is for: the band's
// own offset inside the rail's scrolled content, so the virtualizer can read the rail's scrollTop in the
// band's coordinates. The offset MOVES whenever anything above changes — a row arrives, Snoozed
// expands, a title rewraps — so it is re-measured after every commit (every band above is rendered from
// the board, so a commit is the only way any of them can change) and on any resize of the rail itself
// (a width change rewraps titles above without a commit).
//
// WHAT THIS COSTS, so nobody rediscovers it as a bug: the browser's own find (⌘F) and Tab order reach
// only the rows currently mounted. That is inherent to virtualizing, and the rail is a column of names
// you SCAN — ⌘K searches every thread, mounted or not.
// The rail has no arrow-walk and no programmatic row focus (it is mouse-driven — see the header note),
// so there is nothing here that has to scroll an unmounted row into view before focusing it. If one is
// ever added, it must call virtualizer.scrollToIndex first; a row that is not mounted cannot be focused.
//
// 27px is STRUCTURAL, not a fitted constant: a row is pt-1 + leading-[19px] + pb-1, and that line box
// is fixed, so it holds in BOTH app fonts (`html[data-font]`) with nothing to re-measure when the
// setting flips. Verified: the band's ink pitch reads exactly 27.00px in mono AND in sans, and all 553
// rows measured 27px each, so the whole band is 14,931px estimated and 14,931px real — the rail's
// scrollHeight is 15,120px with the band virtualized and 15,120px without it, and the scrollbar cannot
// tell. Only a WRAPPED title (46px) breaks the estimate, and measureElement corrects it as it mounts.

// hover actions the same way the rest time yields to Retry. The pin stays FILLED but keeps its stroke:
// lucide's needle is a stroke-only line (`M12 17v5`) with no fill area, so strokeWidth 0 would erase it
// and leave a headless blob (measured on the pin mockup sheet, 2026-09-02).
//
// IT WEARS THE HOVER STRIP'S OWN BOX, and that is the whole point: `h-[19px] w-[19px]` centring a 12px
// glyph is exactly ROW_ACTION_CLASS's geometry, so the mark and the unpin button that replaces it on
// hover occupy the SAME 19px slot and the pin does not move — it only swaps for the slashed glyph
// (maintainer 2026-09-03: "it should be in the exact same place when you hover versus not hover").
// The two coincide BY CONSTRUCTION, in both app fonts, at every rail width:
//   HORIZONTAL — this box ends at the button's `pr-1.5` content edge and the strip is anchored
//     `right-1.5` on the same row, so both right edges land on the same x.
//   VERTICAL — `self-start` pins this box to the flex line's cross-start, which is the button's `pt-1`
//     content top; the strip's `top-1` is that same offset from the row. Neither reading depends on the
//     font's metrics, so nothing here needs re-fitting when the type scale moves.
// It replaced a hand-placed `relative top-[calc(5.5px - 0.5cap)]` that sat an 11px mark on the title's
// CAP band (0.01px residual in both fonts) — a better vertical in isolation, but its ink centre landed
// 4.00px RIGHT of the unpin's and 0.09px (sans) / 0.66px (mono) above it, so the glyph jumped every
// time the pointer arrived. This slot centres on the title's first LINE BOX instead, which is where the
// door and Retry have always sat; an absolutely positioned strip cannot reach the in-flow baseline the
// `cap` correction needs, so the whole slot agreeing beats one mark in it being sub-pixel more correct
// at rest. What that costs, measured: the resting pin's ink now ends 4.5px inside the rest time's,
// where the 11px mark ended 0.8px inside it — the hover square's own dead space, and the same inset the
// door already had.
//
// `-ml-1` is a layout trim, not spacing: this slot is 8px wider than the 11px mark it replaced, and
// without the trim the title's own box pays all of it. Giving 4px back leaves the ink gap from a filled

 *  kind and the reason under that — four lines of record, no sentence anywhere in it (maintainer
 *  2026-08-19: "that popover text looks fucking terrible"). Now the state and what it is waiting on are
 *  joined into one clause, exactly the shape every other tooltip on this rail already has ("Stalled —
 *  the agent's process exited"):
 *
 *      Snoozed until tomorrow at 11:11 AM — waiting on acme/app#391 and a background shell
 *
 *      the tap submission is queued behind their CI backlog
 *
 *  The STATE leads because it is what the glyph you pointed at is claiming; the fence's clause follows
 *  because it says what that glyph means on THIS row; the worker's own prose takes a PARAGRAPH of its
 *  own, because it is the one line frizz did not write. The blank line is load-bearing: the sentence
 *  above it wraps, and a reason set directly under a wrapped line reads as its third line — which is
 *  exactly how it looked when they were merely stacked. Nulls and blanks drop out, so a row with no
 *  fence is just its state. */

// thread after the human snoozed its resting card) are ONE fact about the process, and a park does not
// change it. The parked arm wore lucide's CircleDashed until 2026-08-31, which said only "waiting on
// something" — a generic mark for the one state the rail already had a specific one for (maintainer:
// "we use blue dots to represent background shells … if we're not using a blue dot for a thread that's
// awaiting a background shell, then what do we use it for?"). What separates the two is the BAND, which
// dims a snoozed row, and the tooltip, which names the park; the mark itself stays the shell's.
//
// THE DOT MUST NEVER CLAIM LIFE THAT IS NOT THERE (see restingOnLiveBackgroundWork's long note in
// groups.ts, where a green PR wearing this dot was the bug). It cannot here: every arm that draws it is
// already gated on the server's own `awaitingBackground` verdict — an honoured park, checked against
// telemetry the browser cannot see — so by the time either arm runs, the work behind it is live. That
// same gate is why the `agent` hint rides along on the shell's blue rather than the accent-yellow a
// sub-agent pulses elsewhere: a LIVE sub-agent makes isSnoozed false outright (hasLiveSubAgents), so
// the arm is reachable only on a park the server honoured for something else in the same fence.
//
// SINCE 2026-09-20 THE DOT SITS INSIDE THE SPINNER AND NO LONGER PULSES. The maintainer's rule for the
// Running band is that every row spins and the mark inside says what is alive ("an empty square if the
// thread is actively running … a blue dot if there's a background shell, a solid, non-pulsing blue
// dot"). The motion moved from the dot to the frame: the spinner says "something will wake this", the
// solid dot says "it is a shell". The pulse was the dot's way of saying alive-not-moving while the box
// stood still; with the box tracing, a pulsing dot inside it would be two animations for one fact.
// It keeps this same frame in the Snoozed band — the band's own dim (opacity-65 on the row) is what
// says "parked", and the shell really is still running.

// lucide's github path is asymmetric inside its 24-unit grid: the head/body/legs path is centred, but the

// `size` means it survives a resize of the mark, which a pinned 0.375px would not.
//
// NO VERTICAL NUDGE, and this is the part worth keeping, because the obvious instrument argues for one.
// An intensity-weighted centroid reads the glyph 0.33px HIGH — the head is a thick closed loop while the
// legs beneath it are single strokes, so the mark's MASS genuinely sits above its middle. Correcting to
// that centroid moves the whole glyph down and turns a vertical clearance that was exactly balanced
// (2.75 / 2.75) into 3.13 / 2.38: the legs then crowd the bottom wall while the ears gain a gap, which
// is the same defect being fixed sideways, recreated on the other axis. The top-heaviness is intrinsic
// to the LOGO and cannot be translated away — only redistributed — so the bbox stays balanced and the
// residual mass offset stands. Rendered side by side at dsf 8 the untouched vertical is plainly better.
