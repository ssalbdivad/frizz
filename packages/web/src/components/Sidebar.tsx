// THE THREAD ROW — one thread as a line of a list, with its indicator, its title and trailers, and the
// verbs it offers on hover (pin, Retry, reopen). Everything's project list draws
// every project's threads with these (ProjectList.tsx), each group under its project's ThreadProjectScope.
//
// The file is named for the column it was written for: a project's own board, whose floating sidebar
// listed these rows in named bands. The board went with the project view on 2026-09-28 and came back
// on 2026-10-06 as `/project/<slug>` (ProjectBoard.tsx), banded under Colin's names — Pinned, Queue,
// Running, Snoozed, Done, External — with SectionHeader below over each band. All projects lists every
// project's current work with the same rows (ProjectList.tsx), and ARCHITECTURE.md § Board nomenclature
// fixes the bands' names.
//
// ENTIRELY MOUSE-DRIVEN: no arrow-walk, no selection chevron. A row CLICK opens the thread — in the list,
// through its RowScope: its card when the queue is showing it, else its drawer, in place.

// A row's hover-revealed icon action: sized to the title's FIRST line (h-[19px]; the group's top-1
// matches the row's pt-1) so it never exceeds the row height. Bare glyphs — the group draws no box
// around them (its backing is the rail's own base colour under the row's hover wash; see the strip in
// ThreadRow), and only the one under the pointer paints its own square.
// OPAQUE PAINT, TRANSLUCENT BOX — `text-muted opacity-70`, never `text-muted-70`. The unpin is a lucide
// glyph FILLED and STROKED in currentColor, and an SVG paints the stroke over the fill: with an alpha
// colour the ring lands at ~0.8 alpha where it overlaps the 0.7 fill, so the pin read as a darker
// outline around a lighter middle (maintainer 2026-09-11: "slightly dimmer in the middle. It looks
// insane"). Group opacity composites the finished glyph once, so fill and stroke read as one solid
// body. Identical for the stroke-only pin and Retry; `disabled:opacity-50` still wins, as a variant
// utility over a bare one.

  // from the AWAITING BLOCK deterministically (awaitingWaitClause) plus the worker's own handoff prose, so
  // the detail is available on demand and never spends a line of the rail. Live sub-agents are the other
  // reading that costs no line: a quiet count in the right-edge column (SubAgentCount). That is the same call that
  // hid the SNOOZED label (2026-08-03) and the worker's reason (2026-08-16), applied to the last of them.

  // THE HOVER WASH IS AN `after:` PSEUDO PAINTED ABOVE THE ROW, not a background under it. The hover
  // actions overlay the title's first line and need an opaque backing (a long title's last words would
  // otherwise show through the glyphs); painting the wash on top lets that backing be the rail's plain
  // base colour and still match the lit row exactly — in every state and every frame of the fade. As a
  // `hover:bg-*` under the strip, the backing had to be a second, guessed colour, and it read as a

// lucide's needle is a stroke-only line (`M12 17v5`) with no fill area, so strokeWidth 0 would erase it
// and leave a headless blob (measured on the pin mockup sheet, 2026-09-02).
//
// IT WEARS THE HOVER STRIP'S OWN BOX, and that is the whole point: `h-[19px] w-[19px]` centring a 12px
// glyph is exactly ROW_ACTION_CLASS's geometry, so the mark and the unpin button that replaces it on
// hover occupy the SAME 19px slot and the pin does not move — it only swaps for the slashed glyph
// (maintainer 2026-09-03: "it should be in the exact same place when you hover versus not hover").
// The two coincide BY CONSTRUCTION, in both app fonts, at every rail width:
//   HORIZONTAL — this box ends at the button's `pr-1.5` content edge and the strip is anchored
//     `right-1.5` on the same row, so both right edges land on the same x.
//   VERTICAL — `self-start` pins this box to the flex line's cross-start, which is the button's `pt-1`
//     content top; the strip's `top-1` is that same offset from the row. Neither reading depends on the
//     font's metrics, so nothing here needs re-fitting when the type scale moves.
// It replaced a hand-placed `relative top-[calc(5.5px - 0.5cap)]` that sat an 11px mark on the title's
// CAP band (0.01px residual in both fonts) — a better vertical in isolation, but its ink centre landed
// 4.00px RIGHT of the unpin's and 0.09px (sans) / 0.66px (mono) above it, so the glyph jumped every
// time the pointer arrived. This slot centres on the title's first LINE BOX instead, which is where the
// hover verbs have always sat; an absolutely positioned strip cannot reach the in-flow baseline the
// `cap` correction needs, so the whole slot agreeing beats one mark in it being sub-pixel more correct
// at rest. What that costs, measured: the resting pin's ink now ends 4.5px inside the rest time's,
// where the 11px mark ended 0.8px inside it — the hover square's own dead space, and the same inset the
// fullscreen door that stood in the strip then had.
//
// `-ml-1` is a layout trim, not spacing: this slot is 8px wider than the 11px mark it replaced, and
// without the trim the title's own box pays all of it. Giving 4px back leaves the ink gap from a filled
// title line to the pin at 14.0px, against 14.29px before this change.
//
// `besideClock` (a WORKING pinned row, whose task clock stands left of the mark) trims 10px instead:
// the row's gap-3 plus the pin's 6px of dead box drew 14.34px of ink between "12m" and the pin, which
// read as two columns; `-ml-2.5` leaves 8.34px (scripts/ink-gaps.mjs on sidebar-pin-fixture, sans, dsf 4,

 *
 *      Snoozed until tomorrow at 11:11 AM — waiting on acme/app#391 and a background shell
 *
 *      the tap submission is queued behind their CI backlog
 *
 *  The STATE leads because it is what the glyph you pointed at is claiming; the fence's clause follows
 *  because it says what that glyph means on THIS row; the worker's own prose takes a PARAGRAPH of its
 *  own, because it is the one line frizz did not write. The blank line is load-bearing: the sentence
 *  above it wraps, and a reason set directly under a wrapped line reads as its third line — which is
 *  exactly how it looked when they were merely stacked. Nulls and blanks drop out, so a row with no
 *  fence is just its state. */

// ride the tooltip; the children themselves are one click away on the card and in the drawer, which is

// change it. The parked arm wore lucide's CircleDashed until 2026-08-31, which said only "waiting on
// something" — a generic mark for the one state the rail already had a specific one for (maintainer:
// "we use blue dots to represent background shells … if we're not using a blue dot for a thread that's
// awaiting a background shell, then what do we use it for?"). What separates the two is the BAND, which
// dims a snoozed row, and the tooltip, which names the park; the mark itself stays the shell's.
//
// THE DOT MUST NEVER CLAIM LIFE THAT IS NOT THERE (see restingOnLiveBackgroundWork's long note in
// groups.ts, where a green PR wearing this dot was the bug). It cannot here: every arm that draws it is
// already gated on the server's own `awaitingBackground` verdict — an honoured park, checked against
// telemetry the browser cannot see — so by the time either arm runs, the work behind it is live. The
// `agent` hint rides along on the shell's blue rather than the accent-yellow a sub-agent pulses
// elsewhere: in the Snoozed band it marks a sub-agent its worker called a WATCHER (`status: watching`,
// 2026-10-05) — the only shape that parks with a live child — and the child spins on its own row.
//
// SINCE 2026-09-20 THE DOT SITS INSIDE THE SPINNER AND NO LONGER PULSES. The maintainer's rule for the
// Running band is that every row spins and the mark inside says what is alive ("an empty square if the
// thread is actively running … a blue dot if there's a background shell, a solid, non-pulsing blue
// dot"). The motion moved from the dot to the frame: the spinner says "something will wake this", the
// solid dot says "it is a shell". The pulse was the dot's way of saying alive-not-moving while the box
// stood still; with the box tracing, a pulsing dot inside it would be two animations for one fact.
//
// AND SINCE 2026-10-05 THE FRAME SPINS ONLY IN THE RUNNING BAND. The same dot sits in the static box on a
// queued shell rest and in the Snoozed band (`restingShellDot`): a spinner there claimed the thread was
// working when its worker had stopped for the human or parked on a watcher (maintainer 2026-10-03:
