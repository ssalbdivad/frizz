// Two icon verbs sitting shoulder to shoulder, and the tooltip has to name the one you are actually
// pointing at. It did not, first reported on the maintenance pair (Restart worker, Reload plugins):
// hovering Restart and then sliding onto the plug left the RESTART label up while the pointer sat squarely on Reload plugins (maintainer 2026-08-06: "the popover
// associated with the restart button continued to show up. It didn't switch over"). They were in the
// lifecycle footer then, the thread header's action strip later (2026-08-26), and the drawer's ⋯ menu
// since 2026-09-29; the gesture and the bug are properties of any adjacent pair, not of those two, so
// this now drives the strip's Collapse and Open fullscreen icons.
//
// The cause was NOT the thing it looks like. In the footer these two marks wore negative ink trims
// that overlapped their 24px hover squares by 3px, which was the obvious suspect and the wrong one —
// the bug was gone with the overlap still there, and it is gone now with no overlap at all (the header
// strip is untrimmed 28px squares). Instrumenting the triggers
// showed the DOM doing everything right: `pointerleave` on Restart and `pointerenter` on the plug
// both fired, at the same x. Radix was declining to switch, because `Tooltip.Provider` defaults to
// HOVERABLE CONTENT and holds a tooltip open while the pointer is inside the grace polygon between
// the trigger and its content — and this content is a wide box sitting directly above BOTH icons, so
// the neighbour is inside the polygon. `disableHoverableContent` on the provider is the fix; nothing
// in frizz needs to hover INTO a tooltip, and the ones that must stay reachable on touch use the
// clickable branch, which is not Radix at all.
//
// Driven with real pointer movement rather than dispatched events, because that distinction is the
// whole bug: synthetic `mouseover` would have "passed" against the broken build.
//
// Opt-in like this repo's other e2e tests — point it at a vite server for packages/web:
//   npx vite --port 5799 --strictPort   (in packages/web)
//   FRIZZ_TOOLTIP_SWITCH_E2E_URL=http://localhost:5799 nub --test --test-force-exit \
//     'packages/web/src/components/tooltipSwitch.e2e.test.ts'
