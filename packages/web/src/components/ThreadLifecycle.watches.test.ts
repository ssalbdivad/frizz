// ONE THING IS DESCRIBED IN ONE PLACE. The lifecycle footer used to carry an eye whose tooltip listed
// every armed watcher — and every one of those objects was already a row in the strip above it, with its
// own liveness dot. The duplicate was the confusing copy: it named a background shell by the runtime
// handle (`bzvtnt3ig`) that appears nowhere else in the UI, so one shell read as two unrelated things
// (maintainer 2026-08-14: "shells are not watchers… I don't see either of them as background shells
// underneath the prompt box", then "we do not need to redundantly list out background shells inside of
// the watcher icon menu").
//
// The footer is gone (2026-10-05): its verbs close the header's action strip and its context reading
// sits in the header's line of facts, while the rows fold into the counts above the queue card's docked
// prompt box. These are ABSENCE tests, which rot silently — so they assert on the RENDERED MARKUP of each
// surface the footer's parts moved to, given watchers of every kind. A reintroduced watcher readout has
// to render something on one of them, and this catches it whatever it is called.
