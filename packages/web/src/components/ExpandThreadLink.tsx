// THE FULLSCREEN DOOR, ⤢ — the one-click way into a thread's /full page, on the queue card's header and in
// the drawer header's action strip. Recovered from 7a20f425, where it was Colin's door on every surface a
// thread appeared on (it replaced the ↗ "Open in new tab" arrow on 2026-08-28: the fullscreen view is the
// ordinary way to focus on a thread, in THIS tab, with the address bar following — and a new tab only on
// the gestures a browser already reserves for that). The fork moved fullscreen into the drawer's ⋯ menu
// on 2026-09-28 and deleted this; it came back on 2026-09-29 because a verb one click deep in a menu is not
// the same as a door you can see, and the menu's duplicate entry went the same day — so this owns `f`.
//
// It stands in HeaderActions' fullscreen slot in the drawer — the slot the /full page's ⤡ closing half
// (CollapseThreadLink) occupies, so the icon that takes the reader in and the one that brings them back
// share one position (maintainer 2026-09-02).
//
// A real anchor, so ⌘/middle/right-click and "copy link address" need no code; a plain left click
// navigates in place through the drawer menu's own openFullscreen, so both doors take one path — the view
// transition from the drawer's panel, the reader's place, and the way back out.
//
// IN AN EDITOR'S SIDEBAR IT OPENS THE THREAD IN THE BROWSER (lib/embed.ts). The drawer there is already
// the frame's whole width, so /full in the frame would be the same thread with the list gone from behind
// it — fullscreen in name only. The room the door is for is a browser tab's, so it opens the same /full
// page there (`frizz:open-external`; a webview cannot open a window), says so in its icon and tooltip,
// and `f` presses it as ever. The ↗ is the door's own earlier icon: it was "Open in new tab" until
// 2026-08-28.
