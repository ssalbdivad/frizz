// THE FULLSCREEN DOOR — one affordance, three surfaces (the sidebar row on hover, the queue card's
// action strip, the drawer header), all opening the thread's `/full` page. It replaced the ↗
// "Open in new tab" arrow on 2026-08-28: the maintainer wants the fullscreen view to be the ordinary
// way to focus on a thread, in THIS tab, with the address bar following — and a new tab only on the
// gestures a browser already reserves for that.
//
// A real anchor, so ⌘/middle/right-click and "copy link address" need no code; a plain left click is
// intercepted into a react-router navigation (through lib/router's registered navigator, so this
// needs no router context and renders in a bare test). `/full` lives in the same router as the board
// (routes.tsx), so this is a route change, not a document load — wrapped in a VIEW TRANSITION so the
// chat surface visibly slides into its /full position instead of the page hard-cutting. The stack
// clear that used to sit here (the fullscreen page mounts the same DrawerStack and would paint the
// thread's own sheet over itself) moved to StandaloneRoute: the old page is snapshotted two renders
// AFTER this click, so a click-time clear removed the very sheet the transition slides.
