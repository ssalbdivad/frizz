// A THREAD HEADER'S SECOND LINE: the facts about the thread as a whole, in words — "Last active 2m ago ·
// ◔ 74% context · ◎ run 7 of 20". The thread header (drawer and /full) renders it; the context reading
// joined "Last active" here on 2026-10-05 when the lifecycle footer that carried it went (see
// ThreadLifecycle.tsx for the top/bottom split).
//
// The fork's drawer line says more than that, and says it through this component rather than beside it:
// `lead` is what opens the line (the band stamp, BandLabel.tsx), and `children` is what follows the facts
// (where the agent works, a spinoff's parent, the live status line) — each child takes `<FactSep />` as its
// own `lead`, so a reading that renders nothing leaves no separator behind.
//
// The Goal's LOOP READING came with the context. It rode beside the goal mark in that footer (2026-09-29);
// the mark itself moved to the prompt box's rail, a row of fixed 28px squares whose text reserve cannot
// grow with a reading of varying width, so the reading — a fact about how far the thread has got, not a
// control — reads here, led by the same mark so it still names whose count it is.
//
// Hidden when no fact rendered: a thread with no timestamp and no reading draws nothing, and must not leave
// the line's height and 2px top margin behind. The line always holds its `Fact` groups, empty or not, so
// `:empty` cannot see that; `:has` asks whether any of them drew something.
//
// ONE ROW, AND A FACT THAT DOES NOT FIT IS DROPPED WHOLE (FACTS_LINE_CLASS, below). The line used to be a
// plain nowrap row, where the context dial never shrank and everything before it did: at a 420px queue card
// "acme-api · Ready 37m ago · ◔ 74% context" read "s · L. · ◔ 74% context", and narrower still the time went
// to nothing and the line opened on a bare "·" (2026-10-06).

/**
 * A HEADER FACTS LINE: one row of facts in priority order, left to right, where a fact that does not fit is
 * DROPPED WHOLE — with its separator — rather than squeezed. Each fact is a `Fact` group holding its own
 * leading `FactSep`; the row wraps, is exactly one line tall (`h-[1lh]`, 13.75px at the line's 11px
 * leading-tight — measured equal to the old nowrap row), and clips, so a group that would not fit wraps onto
 * a second row nobody sees. A wrapped group takes every group after it along, so the row always shows a
 * prefix of the facts, never one with a hole in it. `gap-y-4` puts that hidden row far outside the 3px clip
 * margin, which is there for focus rings and the chip's hover underline.
 *
 * A group that should TRUNCATE rather than drop (`give`: the project chip, a held card's status, the live
 * status line — each ends in an ellipsis of its own) claims only its `give` width while the row decides what
 * fits, then grows back toward its own width (`max-w-max`) out of whatever room is left. The `give` is the
 * narrowest the group may READ at, so it covers the parts that never shrink — the separator, and the status
 * line's elapsed clock (up to `2h 35m`) — plus a few letters: a group squeezed under them would draw its
 * separator and clock beside an empty ellipsis, which is the "squeezed to nothing" this line exists to stop
 * (measured 2026-10-06 at a 2.5em give: the status text drew 0px at a 560px drawer, leaving "· 4m").
 * A group whose content cannot truncate — the band stamp, a context dial — never takes a `give`: squeezed,
 * it would paint over its neighbour.
 *
 * A cap on a fact (`className="max-w-[50%]"`, the spinoff's) goes on the `Fact`, where a percentage is a
 * share of the LINE. Inside a fact it is a share of the fact's own width, which is the content's width —
 * so it truncated a spinoff handle at half its length with the whole row free.
 *
 * `items-baseline`, for the cap-band glyphs on this line (the context ring, the goal mark, a checkout
 * glyph): each stands on the baseline and lifts itself by `0.5em - 0.5cap`, which needs a baseline to
 * stand on.
