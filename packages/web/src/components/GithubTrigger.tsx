// THE one query definition every gh-gated surface shares (this trigger, App's sign-in hint, the
// picker) so their options can't drift apart.
//
// It deliberately overrides the app-wide `refetchOnWindowFocus: false` (main.tsx). This is the one
// query whose answer changes OUTSIDE the app: the user leaves for a terminal, runs `gh auth login`,
// and comes back. Nothing else re-asks — App's observer stays mounted for the life of the page, so
// the cache entry never goes inactive — and with focus-refetch off the Prompt Box kept the page-load
// answer FOREVER. Measured 2026-08-04 against a live stack: server flipped to authed:true, the icon
// stayed absent for 15s and through focus/visibility events, and only a reload brought it back.
// `staleTime` throttles the refetch so a burst of tab switches can't spawn a `gh` per switch.
// (Signing in from frizz's OWN terminal never blurs the window — that one still needs a reload.)

    // Focus-refetch above covers "the user left, ran `gh auth login`, came back". It does NOT cover the
    // answer going wrong on its own while the tab sits open, and every probe behind this query can do
    // exactly that: they are subprocesses, and `gh repo view` is a live call to api.github.com. On
    // 2026-08-11 the network to GitHub dropped for nine minutes, the answer flipped to inRepo:false, and
    // the icon stayed gone in an open tab long after the network came back — a stuck NO outlives its
    // cause, because nothing re-asks a question already answered. The server-side half of that outage
    // is fixed (gitGithubRemote in packages/server/src/github.ts); this is the half that makes any
    // future false negative — a `gh` that timed out on a loaded machine, a keychain that was briefly
    // locked — heal itself instead of needing a reload nobody knows to do.
    //
    // Only while the answer is NO, so the steady state costs nothing: a yes stops the interval, and the
    // whole feature being visible is the signal that it is right. 60s because it is a subprocess and the
    // cost of being wrong for another minute is one hidden icon, not a broken app.

// control). `githubStatus` is shared with App's not-signed-in hint via the query cache (one fetch);
// detection is cached server-side, `authed` re-checked live, so a later `gh auth login` surfaces it.
// No profile gating: the picker carries its own model/effort selector, so an unloaded or unavailable
// saved pair is something to FIX in there, not a reason to refuse to open.
