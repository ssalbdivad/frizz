// where what frizz knows about the wait now lives.
//
// That popover is ONE SENTENCE, not a stack of facts. Its first cut printed a fragment per hint kind,
// which read as a machine dumping its record (same day: "that popover text looks fucking terrible"), so
// the state and the fence's clause are joined the way every other tooltip on this rail already joins
// them, and only the worker's own handoff prose gets a line of its own.
//
// The two halves are one decision, and this file pins both. The popover half is asserted on the TIP
// rather than on rendered markup, deliberately: a Radix tooltip renders nothing until it opens, so
// `renderToStaticMarkup` cannot see it, and asserting on the icon alone would happily pass a popover
// that said the wrong thing. The row half is asserted on the MARKUP, because that is the surface the
// rule is about.
