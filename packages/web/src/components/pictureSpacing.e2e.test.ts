//
// The invariant (maintainer 2026-08-11, on an image `Read` with the live shimmer under it: "we need
// better spacing under the screenshots … it's too close"): a picture CARD is a tool-activity EXCEPTION,
// so every spacing predicate used to see "a card" and charge the tight 6px run that binds a batch of
// compact bands together. A picture is not a compact band — measured 6.19px from the frame's bottom
// border to the shimmer's box — so it takes PICTURE_STEP against whatever it neighbours, on both sides,
// while the compact exceptions around it keep the run.
//
// The picture card is a SendUserFile delivery now. The image `Read` that prompted the rule folds into
// the collapsed digest since 2026-10-03 (maintainer: "No images or screenshots are visible unless you
// make them visible to the user with the light box"), so it is a bare label row and is spaced like one.
//
// Measured in the browser rather than asserted on the tree because this is layout, and because the rule
// is charged in FOUR places (the between-message gap, the working-indicator gap, the seams inside one
// tool band, and the seams between a message's blocks) that must not drift apart.
//
// The picture itself does not have to LOAD: `/local-image` is not served by a plain Vite dev server, so
// the delivery's gallery lists its path as text — and the gap is decided by the tool's `sentImages`
// field, never by whether the bytes arrived. Point the URL at a server that proxies /_frizz to a real stack if
// you want to SEE the frames while the numbers are checked.
