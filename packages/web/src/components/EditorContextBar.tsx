// THE CONTEXT BAR — the top strip inside a prompt box in an editor's sidebar (plans/vscode-extension.md
// § The editor in the sidebar). It shows what the editor around the sidebar has in front, live from
// `frizz:editor-context` (lib/editorContext.ts): the file, and when code is selected, its range and size.
//
// IT SAYS WHAT THE NEXT SEND CARRIES. A message sent from this box takes the selection with it — or, with
// nothing selected, the file's name and the caret's line — as Claude Code's VS Code extension and Cursor
// do (lib/editorContext.ts outgoingMessage), so the reading here is not a suggestion but the attachment
// itself. The EYE before it is the one switch for the editor reaching Frizz on its own — the extension's
// `frizz.shareEditorState`, which also keeps the agents' editor tool out (lib/editorContext.ts
// setShareEditor): off, the reading is struck through and dimmed, so whether the code is going is legible
// without hovering anything. A click on the reading still adds it as a chip in THIS box, for the human who
// wants it placed in their sentence; the other open files are behind the control's chevron.
//
// The prior art the maintainer pointed at, in this app's own vocabulary: Claude Code's VS Code extension
// names the selection under its prompt ("26 lines selected"), Copilot Chat offers the current file as a
// chip the human clicks to attach, and Cursor's composer lists its context as pills along the top of the
// box. Here the pill the bar offers IS the chip it will make — the same `r2-private.ts:91-116` label
// (contextChipLabel) — so what the human clicks is what lands.
//
// LEAVING ONE OUT. Pointing at the reading turns its file glyph into a × (Cursor's context pills do the same
// with theirs): a click leaves THIS selection — or with nothing selected this file — out of the messages
// until the editor shows something else, while the eye stays on (lib/editorContext.ts leaveOut says why
// that is a different thing from the eye). Left out, the reading wears the eye-off state — struck, dimmed —
// so the two read alike at a glance: what is struck is not going. The glyph then offers to put it back.
// A hover affordance and not a fourth control on the strip: at 300px the hint already gets ~110px, and a
// × drawn at rest would take most of that for an act the human rarely needs.
//
// Two tones, because "is code highlighted right now" is the question the bar exists to answer at a
// glance (the maintainer asked for "some visual indicator" of it): a selection wears the accent, like
// the box's own focus ring; a file with nothing selected is a quiet outline — a suggestion.
//
// The control is a SPLIT button, the shape the lifecycle footer's snooze had (SnoozeButton, until
// 2026-10-05): the reading adds what it names, the chevron offers the rest. A separate "3 open files" label beside it was tried first and, in a 300px
// sidebar, took the room the file's own name needed — `r2-private.ts:91-116` truncated to `r:91-116`.
//
// Embed mode only: in a browser tab nothing writes the editor's context, and the bar renders nothing.
