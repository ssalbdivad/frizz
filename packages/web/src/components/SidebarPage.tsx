// THE PAGE IN AN EDITOR'S SIDEBAR — the desktop app's left column, alone (plans/vscode-extension.md
// § The editor in the sidebar, and the app's own feel). The VS Code extension frames this page at any
// width from ~250px up (lib/embed.ts), and it is the DESKTOP app narrowed, not the phone app: someone who
// uses Frizz in the browser must recognize every surface in it.
//
// The desktop page is two columns: on the left the prompt box over the project list, on the right the
// queue's cards, with a thread's drawer sliding over them. The left column is already a sidebar — it is
// 272px at its narrowest (Sidebar.tsx SIDEBAR_COLUMN_CLASS) — so it is what this page draws, with the
// desktop's own parts at the desktop's own sizes: the prompt box (AllQueues.tsx FocusedComposer, the
// picker in its bottom strip on All projects), and the list (ProjectList.tsx), its 13px rows, rest times,
// spinners, hover verbs and quiet bands unchanged. The right column has no room, so a thread opens in its
// DRAWER, full width (styles.css `html[data-embed] .frizz-sheet-panel`), with the same header, transcript,
// reply box, Snooze and Mark as done the card and the drawer carry on the desktop; ✕ or Esc comes back here.
//
// Rejected, each drawn at 300 and 450px before choosing (build2-shell.md): the desktop's stacked page
// (the prompt box, then every Ready card at full height, the list below them all), which put the list
// thousands of pixels down; and the phone's page, which the first cut used — its own rows at a 15.5px
// title, tabs no desktop has, and touch targets.
//
// NO HEADER. VS Code's title row above the frame is the header (lib/embedRoute.ts): the view's name and
// its counts go there, and its buttons come back as `frizz:command` (lib/embedCommand.ts). What the
// desktop's status row carried that the title row cannot is kept in the page: the view's switcher heads
// the list (ProjectList `switcher`), in the slot the status row's title leaves empty on the desktop.
//
// THE COLUMN IS THE DESKTOP'S, scroll box and all: the prompt box stays put at the top and the list scrolls
// in its own box under it, with the app's 7px inner scrollbar, `mb-5 px-0.5` between them — the desktop's
// column head (AllQueues.tsx), so the box sits 2px inside the list's edges and 20px above it. Until
// 2026-10-01 the whole page scrolled: a wheel over the list took the prompt box with it, the page's
// zero-width scrollbar said nothing about there being more below, and a project dragged to the frame's
// edge never scrolled the list (ProjectList.tsx useListReorder scrolls the `[data-xq-rail]` it is in,
// which was a box that did not scroll). The project cords are drawn here too (ThreadConnector.tsx): with no
// cards, only the cords, which are the desktop list's look as much as its rows are.
//
// THE KEYS ARE THE DESKTOP'S. `j` / `k` step the card being read on the desktop; here, with no cards,
// they open the next or previous queued thread in its drawer, in the list's order — pinned ones included,
// as the desktop's first card is often a pinned one — which is the reading a card gives in the sidebar.
// The thread keys (`r`, `d`, `s` …) then press the drawer's own controls, as they do on the desktop with a
// drawer open (lib/keyboardRuntime.ts). With no drawer open there is no card for them to act on, so a
// thread key OPENS the thread you're on — the row the marker holds, else the first queued one — and stops
// there, so nothing acts on a thread the human has not seen; `r` also puts the caret in its reply box,
// which is all the desktop's `r` does to a card.
