// THE DONE CARD'S WATCH BUTTONS (2026-10-07): one "Watch #N" per pull request or issue the card links.
//
// A finished worker used to park itself on the PR it touched for months (`watch_pr` for 180d, chosen
// blind), so threads vanished into Snoozed whether or not anyone wanted to follow them. It now signs off
// `done`, and following the PR is the human's choice, made here whenever they read the card: the click
// arms the same watcher the worker tools arm and snoozes the thread until it reports
// (router.watchDoneRef). Frizz parks nothing on the worker's behalf — the click is the human's.
//
// OUTLINED, NOT THE WHITE CARD VERB. "Mark as done" is the card's verb and the default answer (it is the
// header's check on the queue, and the white button beside these in the drawer); watching is the
// secondary choice, so it takes the secondary sibling's chrome — the provider-fault card's Retry — and
// sits AFTER the verb so the verb never moves.
//
// Only on the thread's CURRENT done at rest: an older done card further up a transcript names work the
// thread has since moved past, and the click parks the rest the human is looking at.
