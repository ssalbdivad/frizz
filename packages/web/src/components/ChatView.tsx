          `[overflow-anchor:none]` on the scroller below leaves ONE authority over its offset. The

          Chrome's native scroll anchoring corrects it too, off its own anchor node, and neither knows

          TWICE. The queue suspends native anchoring around exactly this hazard

// THE RUNTIME-STATUS LADDER — ONE slot at the transcript's end, nine mutually exclusive rungs, hardest
// reading first, and ONE renderer for all of it.
//
// The transcript draws this slot from two places: the virtualized path's `runtime-status` row, and the
// eager path in ChatView (reachable at count === 0, where there is no virtualizer to hang a row on).
// Both drew their own copy of the ladder, and each ALSO carried its own copy of two derived facts — is
// any rung showing (the slot's gate), and is `working` the rung that won (the spacing above it, which is
// a quiet meta line for that rung and a card's STEP for every other). Six hand-mirrored copies of one
// ladder, and the rung order repeated inside four of them.
//
// That is the awaiting card's own bug (2026-09-04: "it'll re-render the awaiting card in a totally
// different fucking way") one level up: the SAME slot, drawn by more than one piece of code, so which
// one you get depends on the thread's state rather than on anything the reader did. Nothing had drifted
// yet — the copies still agreed, rung for rung — but every one of them had to be edited in lockstep
// forever, and that is not a property to rely on. So the ladder is stated ONCE, here: `runtimeStatusRung`
// decides which rung wins, and everything else is derived from that answer rather than re-deriving it.

  // rebuilds no measurements and adjusts no offset. Every other surface that changes the rows above the
  // reader (a prepend, a pin move) already restores the reader explicitly; this one simply never was.

  // be a constant key; when the ask moved to the tail (2026-08-02) row 0 would otherwise have become
  // `earlier-history:${beforeCursor}` — a key that CHANGES on exactly this trim — waking TanStack's
  // correction to fire alongside the one below, the same double-correction hazard `[overflow-anchor:none]`
  // exists to prevent. So the sentinel keeps row 0's key constant and renders nothing.

// THE LIVENESS MARK, LEADING THE ROW — the same slot, the same width, the same ink correction the

// opposite edge from a sub-agent card's accent one for no reason a reader could name (maintainer
// 2026-07-30: "the blue indicator for a background bash tool is still on the right instead of on the
// left … its rendering should align with the agent tool call component").
//
// The glyphs are the shared child-op vocabulary (lib/childOps.ts + BackgroundOpsStrip), so a detached
// shell is marked the SAME way on its transcript card, in the drawer's ops strip and on the queue card:
// pulsing blue = running, breathing muted blue = alive but quiet. A card with nothing live behind it
// renders NO SLOT at all — an empty reservation reads as a layout bug, which is exactly what the
// dispatch card had to unlearn (see AgentBlock's `mark`).
//
// A pending FOREGROUND command marks itself here too, on elapsed time (lib/operationIndicators.ts) —
// the spinner it used to get at the far right is gone. Detached or not, a shell that is running right
// now is the same fact to a reader, and splitting it across two glyphs at two edges meant the LONGEST
// commands — the ones you actually wait on — were the least visible thing on screen.
//
// A FINISHED op — detached or not — draws NOTHING here, and no slot for it either (maintainer
// 2026-08-01: "remove the status indicator entirely for a sub-agent or background shell that has
// completed"). This column states ONE fact, "something is alive behind this row", so a finished op has
// nothing to say in it; the right-hand reading already carries the outcome and the runtime. A briefly
// shipped static "done" dot is what that ruling overturned: marking every settled card meant the column
// was occupied on nearly every row in a scrolled transcript, which is noise wearing the costume of

// An Agent dispatch rendered as a sibling of BashBlock/ReadBlock: a bordered card COLLAPSED by default;

// prompt body, while the DESCRIPTION itself is an underlined link (PathLink treatment) that drills INTO
// that sub-agent's own transcript in a new drawer — for LIVE and COMPLETED children alike (the drawer
// resolves both; an aged-out one degrades to "unavailable").
//
// THE HEADER MIRRORS THE PROMPT-BOX CHILD LINES (maintainer 2026-07-29). A dispatch card and the
// `ChildOpRow` lines under the prompt box name the SAME running child, so they now read the same way,
// in the same order: the liveness MARK first, then the kind ("Agent"), then the title, then the RUNTIME
// right-justified at the far edge. What that cost, deliberately:
//   • the "[subagent_type]" tag went, on the same ruling as the child lines two days earlier — but it
//     came BACK on 2026-08-27, as a resolved model+effort CELL rather than a raw profile name
//     (maintainer: "subagent dispatch cards should always show effort & model visible"). The ruling it
//     overturns was about repeating the PARENT's profile: a dispatch card names a different runtime
//     from the one the prompt box is set to, and after the effort-only split (frizz:high, the model on
//     the Agent tool's own parameter) the model was on no surface at all. The cell is resolved server
//     side — see subagent-profile.ts — so the card, the drawer, the rail tooltip and the resting
//     card's child line all read the same pair;
//   • the state VERB is gone for the two nominal outcomes. A pulsing dot already says "running" and NO
//     mark at all already says "not running any more", so "running 3 min" / "finished 35m" became a
//     bare runtime. A NON-nominal outcome keeps its verb ("STOPPED · 4 MIN", "FAILED · 12 MIN"): a mark
//     cannot say that, and losing it would delete the one fact the reader most needs.
//
// The reading itself is `ToolMetaReading` — the transcript's shared right-hand slot — so this card's
// petite-caps reading, and the one on the Bash card under it, are the same treatment by construction.
// The MIRROR with the child lines is about order and content, not typography: those lines live in the
// rail, the queue card and the ops strip, where the compact "41m" form earns its horizontal budget;
// this card sits in a column of tool cards and speaks their language. See lib/agentReading.ts.
// Exported for operation-indicators-fixture.tsx: the agent row is the one card family with TWO
// independent status sources (its own state reading + the shared meta slot), so it needs live fixture
// coverage — the double-indicator bug shipped precisely because the fixture skipped it.

// In a THREAD's chat the maintainer's ruling (2026-07-31) applies: "render 'Steered' or SendMessage
// using the same full width notifications, the horizontal rule style component that we render when an
// agent completes." A steer is the same class of event as a completion or an upward report — a child
// this turn touched reaching a notable state — so it draws the same divider and carries no body.
//
// In the SUB-AGENT DRAWER it must stay the CARD, and that is not an inconsistency — it is the other
// half of the same design. The divider's whole contract is "click the title and read it there": a
// steer's text lands in the child's transcript as an incoming message, and an upward report's text is
// read off the child's own `SendMessage` record, which is exactly this card. Hollowing the card out too
// would leave the message unreadable on every surface. `ThreadSlugContext` is set only on a real
// thread's chat (the drawer deliberately provides ChildDrillSlugContext instead), so it is the honest
// test for which surface this is.

// A SendMessage (peer / agent-to-agent messaging) rendered as a sibling of AgentBlock/BashBlock: the

// than a generic SendMessage(...) tool line. The header leads with the petite-caps kind label
// ("Steered", or "Shutdown" for a shutdown_request), then the model's one-line `summary` (muted,
// truncated). The
// chevron expands the MESSAGE BODY, rendered as markdown in a quiet indented block (long bodies clamp
// with a "Show all N lines" affordance, exactly like the Bash/Read/Agent bodies). Default state mirrors
// AgentBlock: COLLAPSED when a summary already conveys the gist, OPEN when there's no summary so a
// bodied message isn't hidden behind a chevron showing nothing but the recipient.
//
// This is now the DRAWER-ONLY rendering — see SendMessageBlock for why the thread's own chat draws a
// divider instead, and why this one has to keep its body.

// Exported so the fixtures render the exact same message (user bubble right, agent prose left, compact
// tool lines) — no duplicate renderer. The project board's queue card reused it too, until 2026-09-28;
// the cross-project card (AllQueuesCard) draws its own prose instead. `answering` (the live message
// only) makes each ```question block answerable in place; without it the blocks render read-only.
//
// MEMOIZED (the render-perf thread's chip-click fix): a queue card re-rendered on EVERY chip click /
// composer keystroke (answer + draft state lived at card level) and on every board delta (TodosView's
// snapshot scope), and each such render used to re-run every visible Message's whole subtree —
// markdown/diff/tool cards included. Props are memo-friendly by construction: `m` keeps identity for
// unchanged messages (TanStack Query's structural sharing on both the poll and socket write paths),
// `answering` is undefined for all but the live message (and identity-stable via useLiveAnswering's
// useMemo unless answers/blocks actually changed), `dense` is a constant. So only the message whose
// inputs really changed re-renders; everything else bails out at the memo boundary.
// `paired` is the precomputed question↔answer pairing for a composed-answer user message (see
// pairAllAnswers — computed at the LIST level because the lookback needs the whole message list, which
// a per-message component deliberately doesn't get). Memo-friendly by construction: it's null (a stable
// primitive) for every ordinary message, so only actual answers-messages ever see a prop change.
// undefined (a consumer that doesn't precompute, e.g. the sub-agent sheet) → internal unpaired fallback.
// Lifecycle controls never belong to a transcript message: every Done card stays presentation-only,
// while the owning thread surface renders one stable footer.
// `shadowedBy` is the registered questions standing at this message's REST (lib/questionShadow), so a
// ```question fence that merely restates one of them never draws its own card — the REGISTERED card is
// the one the human answers, because answering it settles the row. Undefined for every message at a rest
// with no registration, which keeps the memo boundary intact.
// `restingCardShown` — the resting card at the transcript's tail is stating THIS message's ```awaiting
// fence (showsRestingCard on the owning thread), so the fence block is skipped here exactly as a settled
// one is. It has to be a skip at this level and not a null from FenceCard: the block list is interleaved
// with explicit spacers, and a card that renders null still spent one — a 14px gap dangling under the
// prose, above the resting card (maintainer 2026-08-28, with a screenshot of the gap). Only the last
// agent message ever carries it, so the memo boundary holds for every other row.
//
// NO `thread` PROP. It was passed for the spinoff card alone, and a thread object is new on every board
// tick, so it re-rendered every row of a running thread's transcript many times a minute for the sake of
// one card. The spinoff cards read the board themselves (Spinoff.tsx useTranscriptThread).

// (TranscriptCard's CardHead + CardContent): "Answers" as a real sentence-case title flush with the
// card's left padding beside its top-left glyph, and the rows starting on that same left edge.
//
// It composes those pieces instead of using TranscriptCard because it is the HUMAN's artifact and must
// keep the user bubble's identity: right-aligned, capped at 85%, the elevated fill and the
// rounded-br-sm corner. Only the shell differs; the anatomy inside is identical, which is the point.
// The header used to be a right-justified lowercase eyebrow, chasing that bubble alignment — but the
// card's own rows read left-to-right, so it was the one thing in the card fighting its own content.
// Each chosen answer sits in the same accent chip the option chips use when selected (border-accent
// bg-accent/10).
// Each row leads with ITS QUESTION (compact, muted, clamped to two lines — the full text rides the
// title tooltip) so the answers read in context, not as bare numbered rows; a row whose pairing failed
// (count mismatch / no question message found — `question` undefined) degrades to the numbered layout,
// where the number still points a scrolled-up reader at the right block. Answers keep
// whitespace-pre-wrap so a multi-line answer's breaks survive.
// The row number shows ONLY in that fallback. With the question ON the row the question IS the label,
// and a second number can only COMPETE with whatever numbering the worker used inside the question text:
// a batch answering a BURIED ask renumbers its rows from 1 (they may span several messages), so
// answering questions 9–11 of an earlier ask rendered "1" against a question that reads "9. …".

//
// The generic reading is "Thinking…", not "Working…". It shows exactly when the turn is running and

// a turn, the pause after it wrote prose, the step after a dispatch or background op (those keep their
// own card and are excluded from the run — see isToolActivityException), and the INTER-CALL GAP, where
// the last result has landed and the model is reasoning over it. That last one is the long one, and it
// used to keep showing the finished call's gerund, so a 20-second think read as a 20-second tool call
// (maintainer 2026-08-04: "it seems like a tool call is hanging for a long time, but it's only because
// the tool call has already completed and the agent is thinking about the results"). "Working" described
// the SESSION, which is the one thing the reader can already see from the thread being active; the
// model composing its next move is what the slot is actually reporting, and it is what every gerund
// beside it reports too (maintainer 2026-08-01: "Do you think it makes more sense to change it to
// 'thinking'?").
//
// In that gap the generic reading also STATES THE RUN — `Ran 23 tool calls. Thinking…` — because a bare
// `Thinking…` under a clock counting the whole turn reads as a thread that has been thinking for ten
// minutes rather than one that has just done twenty-three things (maintainer 2026-08-08). So the slot
// alternates `Ran 23 tool calls. Thinking…` → the next call's gerund → `Ran 24 tool calls. Thinking…`,
// and the count ticking up is the progress signal. See lib/toolActivity.thinkingToolActivityLabel; the
