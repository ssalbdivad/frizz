//
//   · it renders ONLY on the cue's rows — a spinning row has not handed anything back, so there is no
//     rest to date, and the column would be printing its live activity under a heading that says rest;
//   · the instant is the agent's OWN last output (`lastAssistantAt`), NOT the tailer's last record of
//     any kind — a background sub-agent completing bumps `lastActivityAt` and must not re-date a rest
//     the human is still holding. That is `lastActiveLabelAt`'s whole job, and the same key the band is
//     ordered by, so the column reads monotonically down the cue;
//   · the visible text carries no "ago" (the column position is the "ago"); the exact phrase stays in
//     the hover title, where there is room for it.
