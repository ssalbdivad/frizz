// A DELIVERED recurring prompt, in the transcript: a HAIRLINE NOTIFICATION, the same one every other
// child event in this app wears.
//
// It arrives as an ordinary user turn (frizz pastes it into the worker's composer), so left alone it
// rendered as the human's own bubble — claiming the operator had typed a paragraph the
// scheduler composed, and repeating that paragraph in full every few minutes on any thread actually
// being driven by one.
//
// It briefly rendered instead as a bespoke collapsible row, which was worse for a reason worth
// recording: it was BUILT to look like a tool call rather than BEING one, so it matched nothing —
// "that is not what the rest of our tool calls look like… our tool calls have a consistent UI"
// (maintainer 2026-08-03). Inventing a third idiom to sit between two existing ones is how a transcript
// stops reading as one surface.
//
// WakeDivider is the right home and needed no argument: a beat or a bump is exactly the class it
// already serves — something outside the turn reached a notable state and re-invoked the agent — beside
// a background shell resting, a Monitor timing out, a sub-agent finishing or reporting up, and a
// PR-watcher wake. It also gets the family's centred rule, petite-caps label, icon sizing and measured
// optical nudge for free, which is the whole reason that component exists.
//
// The label is the WHOLE notification: no disclosure, no prompt body. The delivered text is the armed
// text, and the armed text is already legible and editable in the Goal panel — so repeating it inline
// on every delivery adds nothing a reader cannot already get, which is the failure both earlier
// renderings shared.

  // body says nothing about this thread: it is the protocol, restated. Rendered in full it sat as a card
  // ABOVE the agent's actual handoff and read as the more important of the two (maintainer 2026-08-12:
  // "We shouldn't show the stop hook message in the UI, at least not by default").

  // indistinguishable in the transcript. The cadence rides along for the same reason: it names the
  // schedule that was in force when this one fired, not the one armed now.
  // "Goal", because that is what the panel, the prompt box's mark and the delivered trailer all call it since

      // — it fired because the thread stopped, again). They survived the merge of the two features into
      // one prompt precisely because the trigger is what a reader still cannot infer. The Goal control's own
      // glyph is deliberately a THIRD mark — a target with an arrow — because it stands for both at once.
      //
      // The rest trigger's was `CircleStop`, and in a wake line that is backwards: this divider exists to
      // say the agent was RE-INVOKED, and a stop button in the transcript reads as the run ending here.
