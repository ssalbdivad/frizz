// WHERE THE AGENT IS WORKING, WHEN THAT IS NOT THE PROJECT ROOT — one quiet token on a thread's meta line
// (maintainer 2026-09-29: the agent's cwd should be "subtle but visible so its clear where the terminal
// will open and when the agent chooses to use a worktree instead of main").
//
// It renders NOTHING in the ordinary case. `thread.checkout` is absent while the agent works in the
// project's own checkout (the server's liftCheckout, thread-cwd.ts), so a token on every thread would be
// noise that says the same thing everywhere; it appears the moment the agent moves into a linked worktree
// or out of the project, and goes when it comes back. No colour, no badge, no warning: a worktree is a
// choice the agent is allowed to make, and the token only makes it visible.
//
// GEOMETRY. The wrapper is its own `items-baseline` row, so the glyph has a baseline to sit on whichever
// line holds it — the drawer header's `items-center` line or the queue card's `items-baseline` one. On it,
// `self-baseline` + `translate-y-[calc(0.5em_-_0.5cap)]` puts a symmetric 1em glyph's centre on the text's
// cap band in any font at any size (the same browser-computed correction as ThreadTerminals' DONE_ICON), so
// there is no per-font constant here to re-measure. `-mt-[1em]` stops that 1em box, standing on the
// baseline, from rising above the text's own line box: without it the token was taller than the time
// beside it, and the drawer header's `items-center` line then set its baseline 0.5px under the time's.
// Measured on the live stack (sans, 11px, dsf 2 geometry): glyph box centre 0.04px from the text's cap
// band, ink centre 0.27px low (FolderGit2's ink sits a hair low in its viewBox; sub-pixel, left alone).
