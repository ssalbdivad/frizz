// The surface a REGISTERED question renders on — a question a worker created with the `ask` tool, which
// is a row in `thread_question` rather than a fence in a message. That is the whole difference, and it
// is the reason this file exists at all: a fenced question lives and dies with the message carrying it,
// so it vanishes from view the moment the transcript scrolls or the context is compacted, while a
// registration is still owed an answer tomorrow. So these cards do NOT ride the transcript on their own:
// they render at the rest that asked them, or a later one whose ```awaiting fence names them under
// `questions:` (lib/questionAnchor, upstream e157817a, 2026-10-05), and in the slot of an empty
// ```question qst_… marker the worker wrote into its handoff (lib/questionShadow PLACEMENT). The fork drew
// every open card at the bottom of the newest handoff from 2026-09-28 until this merge took upstream's
// placement instead.
//
// The CARD is the shared one (QuestionBlockCard); only the plumbing is new. What a registration adds
// over the other two producers is the STATIC TREE: an option may carry follow-ups that become live only
// once that option is picked, so one registration renders as a stack of cards that grows as it is
// answered. lib/registeredQuestion.ts performs that walk; nothing here decides which nodes are live.
//
// ONE QUESTION AT A TIME (2026-09-29, maintainer: "the agent should receive the answer to one question
// at a time so it can start working but the remaining questions … should stay there"). A question is SENT
// the moment it is complete — a single-choice pick that opens no follow-up, the last of its follow-ups
// answered, an Enter in its own box, a multi confirmed with Enter or Send — and the rest stay open and
// owed where they are. The questions of one `ask` are independent by contract (a dependent one is a
// `followUps` entry), which is what makes one answer actionable alone. A half-filled question (typed and
// not Entered, a multi not confirmed) carries its own Send answer; the group's footer button finishes the
// group, its label naming what it sends and skips (groupFinish); a typed reply still carries anything
// staged ahead of itself.
//
// ONE ANSWERING STATE PER THREAD, however many mounts. The staged picks, what has been sent, and the
// prompt box that carries staged answers ahead of a reply all have to agree, so the state cannot live
// in the stack that draws the cards. `useRegisteredAnswering` holds it for the whole thread; the surface
// mounts it ONCE (RegisteredAnsweringProvider) and every stack on that surface reads it through context.
// A stack mounted with no provider above it (a surface that draws one stack) owns a state of its own.
