          be at the top. I just realized it shouldn't be along the bottom"), taking their ink trims with
          them. Whichever mark leads, its ink — not its box — is what the footer's `px-3` should clear;
          every child here wears an `-mx` trim sized to its own dead space for exactly that reason
          (lib/iconRhythm.ts), and the meter needs none because its ring reaches its own svg edge. */}

// tooltip points at it. (Reopening WITHOUT sending anything is the rail's done checkbox — unchecking it
// — see RowUncheckDone in Sidebar.tsx.)

// Same Check + "Done" pairing the sidebar's rail indicator and the ```done fence card use, so one

// included, settled by that much on the click. Now the ✓ lands where the ✓ it replaces was: measured
// 2026-07-29, footer top and composer bottom both move 0.00px through the swap.

// directly above this footer was ALREADY drawing, one row each, with their own liveness dots. Two
// surfaces for one fact, and the duplicate was the confusing one: it named a shell by the runtime handle
// (`bzvtnt3ig`) that appears nowhere else in the UI, so the same shell read as two unrelated things
// ("shells are not watchers… I don't see either of them as background shells underneath the prompt
// box… we do not need to redundantly list out background shells inside of the watcher icon menu").
//
// It is drift, not a design: the eye came first, and the maintainer then asked for the watchers to be
// shown "underneath the prompt box, similar to how subagents work" (2026-08-13, `githubWatchViews`).
// That strip SUPERSEDED this readout and nobody removed it. The one surface rendering this footer — the
// thread drawer and /full (ChatView.ThreadView) — renders BackgroundOpsStrip one line above it, so
// nothing lost a home. (The project board's queue card rendered both too, until 2026-09-28; the
// cross-project card, AllQueuesCard, borrows only this file's StateButton.)
//
// DO NOT REINTRODUCE A WATCHER LIST HERE. If a wait needs to be visible, it belongs in that strip, as a
// row, beside the sub-agents and shells it is a peer of. What a shell's row cannot say on its own — that
// a watcher is armed on it, so this thread will actually wake when it ends — is stated in that row's own
// tooltip (see BackgroundOpsStrip).

// Also rendered — deliberately redundant — as a white primary button at the bottom of the in-chat
// ```done card (see FenceCard). Same completion mutation and live-session confirmation flow; only the
// chrome differs, via `className`. There is deliberately NO Reopen state: reopening a thread is done by
// sending it another message, so the button is always "Mark as done".
