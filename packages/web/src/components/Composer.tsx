// surface the box sits on, in both themes, the way the transcript's own chip is tinted from the
// bubble's ink (ChatView SentContextBody) — with a softer edge than that chip's (7% fill, 14% edge, not
// 20%): with 1px of side room rather than that chip's 4px, the stronger edge drew a box AROUND the text
// rather than a pill under it. Zero-layout, as every backdrop decoration must be: its side pad is bought back
// by an equal negative margin, so the pill reaches 1px past the token's ink on each side — not the 2px
// it had. Two chips added one after another are one SPACE apart (4.13px in this headless sans; ~3.6 in
// Segoe UI, ~3.3 in SF), and 2px a side then merged their edges into one box in Segoe and SF; at 1px
// they stand 1.3-2.1px apart.
//
// The edge is `inset-ring`, NOT `ring-1 ring-inset ring-…`: the theme names a colour `inset`
// (theme.css --color-inset), so Tailwind also makes `ring-inset` a RING COLOUR utility, and it wins
// over the colour beside it — every pill's edge was drawn in --color-inset (#090b10 in dark, nearly
