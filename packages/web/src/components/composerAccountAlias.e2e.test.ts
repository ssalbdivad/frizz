// D7 REGRESSION. `/login` and `/logout` are frizz-owned account actions, intercepted at the composer
// submit boundary and never delivered to the worker as prompt text. That intercept used to live only in
// the drawer's ThreadActionBar: the queue cue card had its own send path with NO alias check, so typing
// `/login` into a card pasted the literal string into the running agent's stdin. The drawer renders
// components/ThreadComposerBox, which owns the intercept, and these tests pin it there.
//
// And they pin it on the page's QUEUE CARD (components/AllQueuesCard.tsx ReplyBox), which is where it
// regressed a second time: the board's card shared the drawer's box, but when the board was deleted
// (2026-09-28) the card that replaced it had a send path of its own with no alias check, and nothing
// here covered it — the card cases had gone with the board's card. ReplyBox intercepts through
// `parseAccountAlias` now, and the card cases are back, on the card that exists.
//
// Skipped unless a Vite URL serving the fixtures is provided (same pattern as the other *.e2e.test.ts
// here): start `vite` in packages/web and set FRIZZ_COMPOSER_ALIAS_E2E_URL to its origin.
//
// ONE headless Chrome is shared across the whole file (via before/after) — a fresh browser per test is
// wasteful and, on a loaded machine, times out. Each test wipes sessionStorage + reloads so the draft
// cache never bleeds between cases.
//
// SENDING IS ⌘/Ctrl-Enter, not a bare Enter (maintainer 2026-08-26, `lib/composerKeyboard.ts`): every
// prompt box reads as a form field, and a plain Enter is always a newline. These tests pressed a bare
// Enter and so never submitted anything — the modal simply never opened.
