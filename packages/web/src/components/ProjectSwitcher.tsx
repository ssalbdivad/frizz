// THE PROJECT SWITCHER — the page's TITLE, at the left end of the status row over the prompt box
// (StatusRow.tsx): which project the page is focused on, or All projects (lib/pageView.ts). It was the
// queue's FILTER until 2026-09-29, scoping the cards and nothing else while the list kept every project;
// focus mode made one project the page's default view, and the control that chose one project's cards
// became the control that chooses the page's project. It sat at the right end of the READY header until
// later that day, muted — which read as a filter on the queue, not the scope of the whole page, while the
// list's project header named the project a second time. Now it is the one place the focused project's
// name is drawn, and it is drawn as a title: full weight, in the list's project-name type.
//
//   focused:        ▣ acme-api ▾        — the page's project: its list, its queue, where a new thread goes
//   All projects:   ◫ All projects ▾
//
// The menu lists every project in the list's order, then the Home workspace under a rule with the folder
// its agents run in (as the prompt box's picker lists it), with All projects above them all as the one
// view that is not a project. Each wears its counts — its asks, its Running, and its Queue, the accent
// badge (SwitcherCounts) — as upstream's rail wore each project's on its square. Choosing one is a
// NAVIGATION (`/project/<slug>`, `/`), so Back returns to the view before.
//
// It must not read like the prompt box's project picker (AllQueues.tsx ProjectPicker), which All projects
// still has: that one says where a new thread GOES, this one what the page SHOWS. So this one is the
// page's title, above the box, and that one a pill inside the box's bottom strip beside the model.
