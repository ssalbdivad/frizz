// THE OWNER MARK sits IN THE MARK SLOT — the 9px column the liveness dot used to fill — and its hue is the
// row's liveness. Not a glyph slot of its own beside the tag: `.frizz-kind-tag` is a fixed track so every
// label on the strip starts at one x, and a second slot would push these labels 14px right of the AGENT
// and WATCH rows around them (the drift the maintainer caught on 2026-09-11, "The label is further to the
// right. Why?"). The slot is 9px and the glyph 1em (11.5px), so it overflows 1.25px a side into the row's

//
// `Bot` for the agent's, `SquareTerminal` for yours. A human head was tried for "yours" and dropped
// (BandLabel.tsx: at 11px a round head reads as an emoji), and the terminal glyph is the one your own
// terminals already wore.
//
// GEOMETRY: CENTRED, like the dot it replaces. Every mark on this row — arrow, glyph, tag, ×, readings —
// is centred on the one flex line, which is where a sans 11.5px label's cap band sits. Both glyphs ink
// their 24-unit viewBox symmetrically (lucide's bot y 3–21 with its stroke, antenna to chin; the terminal
// square y 2–22), so a centred box is a centred ink. That only holds because the LABEL is put on that line
// too — see LABEL.
//
// MEASURED, label cap-band centre minus each mark's ink centre (negative = the mark sits lower), on the
// live stack in sans at dsf 6, 2026-09-29 (canvas cap band at 10× size — the 1× metrics round the cap
// ascent to a whole pixel on this box and read every mark ~0.35px lower than it is):

// measured constant, MARK_LIFT: −0.03em = 0.35px at 11.5px, which leaves both label fonts within 0.1px
// (sans −0.06, mono +0.10) — one lift, because the owner mark must not change height between an agent
// row and yours. The arrow, the tag and the readings are text on the same line and need none. The AGENT
// row (ChildOpRow) keeps its own dot and ×, measured the same −0.40 and untouched here: that row is every

//     terminals running" here and "your run ended" there. Azure is what running means on every surface
//     (the strip's liveness hue); the dimming is what says "not yours".
