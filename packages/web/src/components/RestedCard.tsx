// THE RESIDUAL RUNG: the card for a rest that carries NOTHING ELSE. Every other ending has its own card —
// a done (fenced or registered), a question (fenced or registered), a declared or registered wait, a
// native ask, a permission prompt, a limit pause, a provider fault, a human snooze — and a rest that is
// none of those drew nothing: the transcript simply stopped, on the thread page, on /full and on the
// queue card alike, and nothing on the page said whether the worker was finished, waiting or dead
// (maintainer 2026-08-27: "A thread should never come to rest like this without some indication of its
// handoff"; then "always some kind of handoff card that will show up no matter what").
//
// Two shapes reach it. A BARE REST — the worker spoke last, signed nothing off, registered nothing — is
// the one the sign-off nudge exists for (scheduler.evalSignoffNudges), and the card says so in the
// worker's absence. A STALL — the process exited mid-turn (`crashed`) — is not a rest at all, and the
// card says that instead, beside the header's Retry. Both are last in ChatView's chain: every rung above
// is a harder reading of the same slot and wins it.

/** Does the chat show the residual card at the bottom of this thread? True only when the thread is at
 *  rest (or has exited) in the human's queue and NO other ending applies — every card-bearing state is
 *  excluded here by name rather than by the chain's ordering, so the row builders' gate (which is an OR
 *  over every rung) opens exactly when this rung renders and never for an empty slot.
 *
 *  `lastAssistantText` is the transcript's own copy of "no ```done, no ```question" in the final message:
 *  the board's `pendingQuestion` and `lastFence` say the same, but the message is what the reader is
 *  looking at, and a card claiming no sign-off directly under a fenced one would be the two disagreeing. */
