// ANSWERING ON A PHONE — one question at a time, in a sheet that slides up from the bottom.
//
// THIS ONE SERVES THE RETIRED ```question FENCE ONLY: a live fence still exists on a thread dispatched
// before QUESTION_FENCE_RETIRED_AT, and its answer state is per-message (MessageAnswering), sent as a
// composed follow-up. A REGISTERED question — the only kind since 2026-09-11 — is answered in
// RegisteredAnswerSheet, opened from the bottom bar, over the thread-wide registered state and the
// answerQuestions RPC. The two controllers share neither state nor transport, so they stay two sheets.
//
// The mockup's first attempt put a per-question "Answer" button in the transcript that opened a PAGE
// rendering every question at once with a single Send at the bottom, and the maintainer took it apart
// (2026-08-17): "will there be an answer button like that on every question? When you open it up, for
// some reason it's showing you all of the questions. Seems odd, very odd… I think it's nicer to only
// show a single question at a time in that pop-up. It'd also be nicer if it slid up from the bottom,
// the question pane, so it feels more like a modal and less like you are pushing a new page."
//
// So: one step per question, presented as a modal rather than a place you navigate to. The transcript
// keeps the questions in view behind it — read-only, in the context that produced them — which is the
// other half of that review ("you should just be clicking into the thread in order to review the rest
// of the message and the full context, and then answer the questions that way").
//
// IT OWNS NO ANSWER STATE. The chips, the free-text and the send are the SAME `MessageAnswering`
// controller the desktop cards use (lib/answering.ts, scoped to this message), so a phone answer and a
// desktop answer travel the identical path and a half-filled answer survives closing this sheet. All
// this component adds is which block is on screen.
//
// THE VERB IS "CONTINUE" UNTIL THE LAST STEP. With one question in front of you, "Send" would claim the
// whole ask went back when only this answer was kept; the last step is the only one that submits, and
// it is the only one that says so.
