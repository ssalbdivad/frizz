// Every card the transcript sets off from the prose — the ```done / ```awaiting signal fences, a
// ```question block, and the runtime banners (permission, provider fault, usage-limit pause, native
// input) — wears the SAME shell, body scale and action row, so they read as one family rather than a
// pile of one-off shapes
// (maintainer 2026-07-24: "I like the little checkmark with the Done label — we should have something
// similar for all the other kinds of cards").
//
// The ANATOMY came from shadcn/ui's Alert (maintainer 2026-07-29: "the default shadcn call-out or
// alert box looks way better than ours"), minus its gutter. Two rules carry the look:
//
//   1. The kind is a real TITLE: sentence case, body size, medium weight, full-strength in the tone's
//      own color, flush with the card's own left padding. It used to be a 10px UPPERCASE eyebrow,
//      which reads as a metadata tag stuck above the card rather than as the card's headline.
//   2. The glyph LEADS the title row, top-LEFT, beside the title — but it is not a gutter. shadcn
//      indents the description to clear its icon; frizz does not, because that indent spends ~24px of
//      every card's width on a decoration and leaves the body hanging off the one edge that should be
//      flush (maintainer 2026-07-29: "I don't like how much space there is left padding for the actual
//      content"). Only the TITLE steps right of the glyph; body and actions start on the card's own x.
//      (The glyph sat at the far right from 2026-07-29 until 2026-09-30, when the maintainer asked for
//      it "back to the left. Upper left instead of the upper right.")

// The card's MEANING, and the ONLY thing allowed to vary between kinds (maintainer 2026-07-24: the
// styling across kinds was "vastly different… almost no consistency"). Every card is otherwise the
// same shell — same fill, same border weight, same padding, same body scale, same action row — so a
// tone is a two-token swap on the border and the title, never a different card:
//   neutral   — a statement of fact (done, awaiting, a question)
//   attention — the agent is BLOCKED on you, answerable only in your external terminal
//   caution   — frizz paused itself and will continue on its own (a usage limit)
//   risk      — the ACTION is irreversible, but nothing is wrong (a destructive gate awaiting a choice)
//   danger    — something is BROKEN (a sign-in fault)
//
// Only THREE border colors, though: `caution` and `risk` both keep the neutral border and say their
// piece in the title alone. Caution's amber and the accent gold sit ~15° apart on the wheel, so as two
// lit borders they were indistinguishable — and a self-resolving pause must never compete for the eye
// with "your agent is stuck waiting on you". Border = how loud; the title = what it is.
//
// `risk` SPLIT OFF FROM `danger` on 2026-08-26 (maintainer: danger questions "look way too scary"),
// applying that same law to the other end. A destructive gate and a dead sign-in were wearing one
// full-strength red border, and they are not the same event: one is a question waiting on a choice
// nobody has made wrongly yet, the other is a thing that has already failed. A question is a statement
// of fact with a consequence, so it keeps the neutral border and turns its TITLE red. Danger stays loud
// for what is actually broken.
//
// The tone color lands on the icon AND the title together, as shadcn's `[&>svg]:text-current` does:
// they are one object, and a mismatched color would read as an unrelated badge rather than as the
// title's own mark.

// The corner EVERY block-level element wears — this card, a tool card, a code fence, a table, an
// image, a queue banner. It is the Tailwind half of `--block-radius` in styles.css (both 12px, and
// they must stay equal): JSX imports this, CSS uses the var. Cards used to be the only thing rounded
// this far, so a signal card sat directly above a 6px tool card and an 8px image and no two of them
// read as the same product (maintainer 2026-07-31: "we should make the rendering consistent across
// all of these block-level elements").
//
// It went out at 16px first and that was too round (maintainer, same day: "goes a little overboard
// sometimes… It starts to impinge in expanded view"). See the var in styles.css for why the fix is
// this number AND every block's inset together, not the radius alone.
//
// OUTER containers only. A row or button NESTED inside one keeps the 6px control corner
// (CARD_ACTION_RADIUS below).
export const BLOCK_RADIUS = "rounded-xl"

// border — one pixel tighter, because the shell's PADDING box is what the child actually meets.
//
// A child that is squarer than that arc juts OUT through it, and since an in-flow child's background
// paints after its parent's border, it erases the border exactly where the corner turns. That is what
// the queue card's lifecycle footer did: it kept a literal `rounded-b-[7px]` from back when the shell
// was 8px, so at 12px the left border ran down, dissolved through the bottom-left arc and picked back
// up along the bottom edge — a notch on the corner of every cue card (maintainer 2026-08-01). The
// footer's `backdrop-blur` widened it, smearing the border it was already covering.
//
// Written as calc() off the var rather than a second literal so the pair CANNOT drift again: change
// `--block-radius` (and its `rounded-*` twin above) and the inner corner follows on its own.
// (The `_` are Tailwind's escape for the spaces CSS `calc` requires around its `-`; without them the

// row than it did beside the word: a glyph a pixel low at the far edge reads as a dropped corner.

// inside a 24-unit viewBox, so at 16px the Hourglass inks 3.33px in from its box, the Check 2.67px and
// the KeyRound 1.33px. On a shared `gap-2` that set the glyph 1.3–3.3px in from the body copy's left
// edge and drew 10.0–12.7px of ink between glyph and title, a different distance on every card kind.
//
// So the BROWSER measures each glyph, rather than a table of per-icon constants that the next icon

// about all three of fill (panel-2 / elevated / an accent or red wash), border color, and whether they
// carried a shadow — which is what made nine sibling cards read as nine unrelated shapes.
//
// Radius and padding are ONE decision, not two, and which rule binds them depends on which is bigger.
// This card spent a day at the CONCENTRIC solve — two nested corners share an arc centre iff
// `cardRadius − buttonRadius == inset`, which at a 13px inset (p-3 + the 1px border) and the standard
// 6px control corner wanted ~19px, and 16px was the closest in-vocabulary token. The maintainer then
// asked for the opposite trade (2026-07-31): less radius, more inset, because 16px "goes a little
// overboard" and the tight inset let the arc crowd the content ("it starts to impinge in expanded
// view"). That inverts the geometry — at p-4 (a 17px inset) and a 12px corner the solve runs NEGATIVE,
// so there is no button radius that could be concentric with this card.
//
// That is not a compromise, it is a different regime, and it is the one to reason in from here: once
// the inset EXCEEDS the radius, the action sits entirely clear of the arc, the two corners never share
// a corner region, and the eye reads them as independent rather than as mismatched. So the button keeps
// the ordinary control corner (CARD_ACTION_RADIUS) and does NOT track this card's radius. Only go back
// to the concentric solve if the inset ever drops below the radius again.
//
// The wider inset is also what makes the corner safe for the card's CONTENT: an arc eats the top-left
// of its own box, so the same 12px/16px pairing is applied to every other block (styles.css
// `--block-radius`, the tool cards in lib/diff/diff.css) rather than to this card alone.
//
// The padding stays UNIFORM, so the bottom gap equals the sides. It reads a touch deeper than an equal
// metric gap under a text line would, because leading donates optical space that a solid filled button
// does not — but the answer to that is not an asymmetric inset, it is that the whole card is now roomy
// enough for the difference to stop registering.
