// A completion registered with `mcp__frizz__done` is in no message, so the transcript's fence parser
// never draws it — and until 2026-08-27 nothing else did either: the thread rested on a prose handoff
// with no card at its end, on the thread page, on /full and on the queue card alike. These pin the
// wiring: the card is the LAST rung of the runtime-status ladder, above the residual rung.
//
// They used to pin it TWICE — once per transcript path — and pin each path's own gate beside it, because
// the ladder was written out in both and a rung without its gate is a card that never renders (a gate
// without its rung is the empty slot of 2026-08-25, one surface over). The ladder is ONE function now
// (runtimeStatusRung) and both gates are that one call, so there is no second copy to keep honest and no
// gate that can disagree with it: what is left to pin is the ORDER of the rungs, and that the gate is
// derived rather than restated.
