// THE PROMPT BOX'S SCHEDULE (ARCHITECTURE.md § Scheduled threads). There is no schedule button and no mode: the box
// works out from the words whether Enter should start the thread or create a schedule. A prompt with a schedule
// word in it ("every", "weekdays", "morning", a weekday's name — packages/shared/src/schedule-trigger.ts) is read
// by the model as it is typed (lib/scheduleReadScheduler.ts), and when the model says the words ask for the work
// to repeat, the box says so before Enter:
//
//   every Monday at 9am triage new issues          ← the phrase in the accent mark
//   └ ↻ Every Monday at 9am · next Mon Oct 12, in 6d                      ×   ← the STRIP
//       Each run: triage new issues
//
// and the send button wears ↻: Enter creates that schedule. × (or Esc) says "not a schedule", and Enter starts
// the thread. Text with no schedule word looks exactly as the box always has; words with one that turn out not
// to be a schedule ("fix the bug from this morning") show nothing but a faint mark on the word while the read is
// out. What each submit does is lib/scheduleIntent.ts (`submitAct`, `settleAct`), pure and tested; this file
// executes it. Enter never waits on the model: words it has not read yet leave the box at once, and a toast says
// what they became once their reading lands.

/**
 * THE STRIP'S RHYTHM, in one place. `gap` spaces boxes and the eye spaces ink, so every mark's box is collapsed
 * onto its own ink (iconRhythm.ts's method) and the gaps below are the distances the eye reads. Dead space is
 * GEOMETRY, not a fit: a lucide glyph's stroke (2 units) reaches 1 unit past its outermost path, so `Repeat`
 * (paths x 3–21) leaves 2 of 24 units a side and `X` (x 6–18) leaves 5.
 *
 * Measured with scripts/ink-gaps.mjs (pixels, dsf 6, 12px sans) on schedule-live-fixture's ledge, at 1440 (514px
 * wide) and on the phone's tap row at 360 (290px), 2026-10-06 — the same at both widths:
 *   border → ↻ 10.83 (the left inset)    ↻ → reading 8.00    × → border 10.83 (the left inset)
 *   `Each run:` starts 0.00px off the reading's first letter; ↻ and × centre 0.13px under the cap band (geometry,
 *   sub-pixel: left alone).
 * Before the trims, the glyph floated halfway between the border and its words (9.67 to them) and the × hung
 * 6.5px further out than the gap it shared: 4px of button padding plus 2.5px of its viewBox.

 * longest that fits. A ResizeObserver re-fits it as the sheet turns.

 * lands, which replaces it in place, or takes the strip away. `stale`: it is the answer for other words and no
 * read is coming for these (the budget spent, the read failed) — drawn faint and still, never as these words'.
