/**
 * THE EDITOR BESIDE THIS TAB, in one quiet line at the right of a prompt box's footer — `VS Code: a.ts:12-20`
 * — naming what the agents' editor tool would read now, and adding it as a chip on a click (lib/
 * editorFront.ts says why a browser tab gets this and the sidebar gets its whole bar instead).
 *
 * In the footer, not along the top as the sidebar's bar is: the bar is the sidebar's main way in and earns
 * its row, while here the line is a side note beside a box the human mostly uses for other things, so it
 * takes the footer's free right end and costs the box no height. Muted and borderless like the footer's
 * interrupt hint, so it reads as information first and a control on hover — the paperclip's hover.
 *
 * Nothing renders until the server says a window with this project shares its editor: with VS Code closed,
 * sharing off, or another project in front, the box is exactly as it was.
