// EVERY WAKE FRIZZ DELIVERS, rendered as frizz speaking rather than as the human's own words.
//
// Named for the whole family since 2026-08-19, when the last two members joined it: it was
// `GithubWakeCard` back when a review steer was the only thing it drew, and the name outlived the job by
// two features. What arrives here is any user turn the server flagged `wake` — a PR watcher's review
// activity, its status lines, a background shell that finished while nobody was awake, and whatever the
// parsers below do not recognize.
//
// THE RULE THE WHOLE FILE FOLLOWS: a wake frizz composed ITSELF is a hairline, because it is one line of
// news about something outside the turn. A wake carrying prose someone else WROTE — a worker's own timer
// text, a message this build cannot parse — keeps the card, because a card is the shape with a body in
// it. The agent-facing trailer that frizz appends to its own messages is dropped in every case: it
// instructs the worker about its own registrations, and the human reading the transcript has none.
//
// The wake is recorded as an ordinary user turn (it is pasted into the worker's composer), so the chat
// rendered it in the right-justified bubble the human's messages wear — which claimed the
// operator had typed a message the PR watcher composed. This is the correction.
//
// It is a WAKE DIVIDER, not a card (maintainer 2026-07-31, after a gallery of ten alternatives: "I hate
// the design of the new comment notification card… it just feels wrong"). The diagnosis that picked
// this shape: the transcript already had one idiom for this class of event, and this was the only
// holdout. A background shell coming to rest, a Monitor timing out, a sub-agent finishing and a
// sub-agent reporting up all render as WakeDivider — and a PR-watcher wake is the same class, an external
// event the worker was waiting on that reached a notable state and re-invoked it. It alone still wore a
// full TranscriptCard, which is what made it read as a different, louder kind of thing than it is.
//
// Three defects went with the card and are gone with it: ~350px of dead air between a left-pinned title
// and a right-pinned ref; a p-4 inset wrapped around a SINGLE 20px line, when every other card in that
// shell has a body; and three marks on one row that all looked clickable (an underlined title, an
// accent ref, the corner glyph) with no hierarchy between them.

// ---- THE ROW LIST IS GONE (2026-08-13) -----------------------------------------------------------
// A burst used to hang one row per item under the divider — actor, kind, age, each its own permalink.
// Two things killed it, and they point the same way.
//
// IT DID NOT SCALE, and the case that broke it is the common one. The first park on a PR replays
// everything already sitting there, so a PR that has been open a while rendered its whole review history
// into a queue card: "For PRs that have been around for a long time, it's going to render like a hundred
// reviews, so let's hide all of that on the initial watcher registration" (maintainer 2026-08-13).
//
// AND NOBODY NEEDED IT HERE. The full detail still reaches the WORKER — every item, with its permalink
// and its read-the-inline-comments instruction, in the delivered steer — which is where it is acted on:
// "we could certainly surface all of those things to the agent quietly, just so the agent knows the
// history… the agent can kind of handle it itself". What the transcript owes a human is one line saying
// the watcher fired and roughly what landed, with the PR one click away. That is the divider.

// `at` is the DELIVERY's instant — when frizz pasted this wake into the composer — and it is what every
// hairline here dates itself by, with two exceptions that carry a better one of their own: a single
// review item dates by GitHub's clock (when the comment was filed, which is the news), and a timer by
// the instant it was set to fire.

// A one-off's registration is gone the moment it delivers.
//
// So: the family's shape, with the body one click away (maintainer 2026-08-19, over both a card and a
// bare line). The TOGGLE is real — the two clickable dividers that came before this one expand ONE WAY
// and unmount — which is why `WakeDivider` grew `ariaExpanded`/`ariaControls` for it.
//
// The affordance rides the LABEL, not the icon, and that is deliberate: every wake divider's glyph says

// class of event as the review divider below, so it wears the same chrome — which it did not until
// 2026-08-18, when it was the last thing a registered watcher said that still arrived as a full-width
// bordered card. Two of them stacked under a run of hairlines is what prompted the fix ("these callouts
// should obviously be hairlines"), and the card was carrying LESS news than the hairlines above it: the
// only thing under its title was one line of state and a parenthetical addressed to the worker.
//
// THE TRAILER IS DROPPED, not rendered. "This watcher is spent" and "STILL ARMED — drop it with
// mcp__frizz__watch_pr" are instructions to the agent about its own registration; a human reading the
// transcript has no watcher to re-register and no tool to call.
//
// STATE FIRST, ref second, matching the review divider's `{title} on {ref}` — so the news survives the
// truncation at queue-rail width, where the label clips from the right.

  // A wake carrying exactly ONE item is the common case by far, and it is said entirely by the divider's

  //
  // So the two collapse into one: the visible text stays `owner/repo#N`, but for a single item the href
  // is that ITEM'S PERMALINK. "Read that exact comment" is the whole point of the wake, and a comment
  // permalink IS a url on that PR — following the ref lands you on the PR *at the comment*, which is
  // strictly what you wanted from either of the two links. A burst has no single item to deep-link, so
  // it points at the PR and its rows carry their own permalinks.
  const href = only?.url ?? refUrl
  // "ALREADY on", not "caught up ON … ON": the ref is appended with `on` below, so any title ending in a

  // '2 new items …' Looks fucking insane because it's mixing small caps with regular font").
  //
  // The label used to escape three of its own runs back to ordinary case with `WAKE_DIVIDER_IDENT` — the
  // login, the ref and the age — on the reasoning that a GitHub token is something you match by eye and
  // small capitals make it read as prose. Each escape was defensible alone; together they alternated the
  // line's casing FOUR times in twelve words, and the line stopped reading as a line.
  //
  // So it wears its family's treatment whole, like every other divider in the transcript (the shell
  // wake, the sub-agent wake, the collapsed-run summary — all petite-caps end to end). The ref keeps its
  // link underline, which is what marks it as the thing to press; it no longer needs a second signal in
  // a different alphabet. `WAKE_DIVIDER_IDENT` survives for callers with a genuinely mixed line.
  //
  // THE REF NEVER TRUNCATES FIRST. It is the line's one link and the only thing on it a reader can act
  // on, and it sat at the END of the one truncating run — so at a 300px VS Code sidebar's width the line
  // read "NEW REVIEW COMMENT FROM @… · 1H AGO" and "NEW APPROVAL FROM @DANA O…", the link clipped to 0px and
  // nothing carrying it, and at 450px it was cut mid-token ("NUBJS/NUB#5…"). Now the sentence is its own
  // truncating run, so the actor goes first and then the kind, while " on " and the ref stay whole: they
  // ride in one `shrink-0` group, capped at the line (`max-w-full`), so only a ref too long for the line
  // on its own ever truncates. NOT a lower shrink factor on the ref — a truncating box that shrinks by
  // even a twentieth of a pixel draws its ellipsis, which is how a first cut showed "NUBJS/NUB#5…" beside
  // a sentence that had all the squeeze. The whole sentence is the run's title. Same spacing as before:
  // the pieces sit in flex runs with no gap, and " on " is its own whitespace-preserving text, as the
  // shell wake's «name» does it (ShellWakeText).
