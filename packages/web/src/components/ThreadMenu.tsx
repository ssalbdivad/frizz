 * (its project's prefix), because the page's is the focused project's. `from` is any element inside that surface: the surface is read off it once, whether or not the
 * navigation animates, because it is also what the reader's place is measured against (the scroll
 * hand-off is continuity, not decoration, and a reader on reduced motion needs it more, not less). The
 * drawer-stack clear this needs happens on the /full route's first render (routes.tsx StandaloneRoute),
 * not here: the old page is snapshotted two renders AFTER the click, so a click-time clear removed the
 * very sheet the transition slides.
