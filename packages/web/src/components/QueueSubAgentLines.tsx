// A queue handoff should name the work still running beneath the parent without turning it into a
// second operations toolbar. Live AND stale children render here (visibleChildOps "card", unified onto
// the rail's policy — a stale child is unresolved work, not gone, and a card that hid it read as "done
// underneath" while the rail still showed it); background shells/Monitors remain in BackgroundOpsStrip
// below as a separate runtime concern. The row itself is the shared ChildOpRow at "card" density — the
// same component, tokens and glyph the sidebar rail and the drawer's ops strip render. The dispatch's
// model+effort tag was REMOVED from these lines on 2026-07-27 (maintainer): the profile belongs to the
// prompt box's own control one line up, not repeated on every child line. It still rides the drill-in
// so the drawer knows which cell it opened.
//
// It DOES carry the dismiss × (maintainer 2026-07-30 — "the X button to stop a sub-agent should show up
// everywhere sub-agents are listed"). That is not the "second operations toolbar" this comment has
// always warned against: the card names the live work, and retiring a child that finished without
// signalling is the one action that reading provokes. The counters and the profile still stay off the
// card. The kind tag does not, since 2026-10-03: the shell, watcher and File/Link rows that continue this
// column below are tagged, so an untagged agent line here started a tag's width left of all of them —
// and the same child lost its tag every time its thread moved from the drawer to the queue (see
// ChildOpRow).
// Whether this card will actually draw any ⤷ child lines. The card renders these lines and the
// background-ops strip as two SIBLING lists in one visual column, so the strip has to know whether it
// is opening that column or continuing it (the project board's card, TodosView, asked this until
// 2026-09-28; subagent-completion-fixture and operation-indicators-fixture still do) — and it must get
// the same answer this component does. Exported from here, and used by the component itself, so the two cannot drift.
