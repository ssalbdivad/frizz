// THE PAGE — one project's list and queue, or every project's: `/`, showing its VIEW (lib/pageView.ts).
//
// ALL PROJECTS — the default, bare `/` — is every project's list and ONE queue across all of them. FOCUSED
// ON A PROJECT — `/?project=<slug>`, from the switcher — the list on the left is that project and the
// queue on the right is its cards, and the prompt box dispatches into it. The two are
// the same page drawn from the same parts, not two UIs: the list's bands (ProjectList.tsx) are identical in
// both, and focus mode is All projects with one project in it and the prompt box's picker gone.
//
// It is laid out as a project's own board was, one level up — the board was a floating sidebar beside a
// 720px queue, until 2026-09-28 when this page replaced it. The list on the left is the view's PROJECTS,
// each with its own queue rows and running rows beneath it, in the operator's own rail order
// (ProjectList.tsx). The queue on the right is a column of cards in the order each card entered it; showing
// All projects it is ONE queue across every project (maintainer 2026-09-28: "One queue across all
// projects"), each card wearing its project's chip (AllQueuesCard.tsx ProjectChip). It was one LANE per
// project, in rail order, until then, and a project listed above the one being read put its whole lane
// on top of the card the operator was reading the moment its first thread came to rest.
//
// NOTHING HERE LEAVES THE PAGE. There is no project page to leave for (routes.tsx), and fullscreen is a
// choice in a drawer's own menu (ThreadMenu.tsx), not a door on a card. The page is BOUND to one project
// — the page project: the prompt box at the top of the column dispatches into it, and a thread of it opens
// in the page's drawer stack, in place. Focused, that is the view's project; showing All projects, it is
// the box's own choice (the PICK, chosen in its bottom strip). Opening a thread of ANOTHER project moves
// it to that project for as long as the drawer is open (`/all/<slug>/thread/<t>`, useOpenThreadInPlace),
// so every thread on the page is one click from its full transcript without leaving the page, and closing
// the drawer returns home to the view.
//
// THE DRILL-DOWN, three steps, each one click, none of them leaving:
//   1. the card — the handoff's opening lines, the questions, a reply box, Snooze and Mark as done;
//   2. "Show more" — the whole handoff, in place;
//   3. the card's title (or a rail row) — the thread's drawer, with its whole transcript and composer.
// (A card's ↗ and a project's "…" → Open board were doors to that project's board until 2026-09-28.)
//
// WHAT THE RAIL AND THE CARDS MUST NEVER DO is ask the page which project anything belongs to. The page
// project is only what the page is BOUND to, and they may show every project. Every read they make is either machine-wide
// (`projectsList`, `projectsQueues`) or carries its project explicitly, and every action goes through
// that project's own client (`projectRpc`). See AllQueuesCard.tsx for the card's half of the same rule.
// The prompt box and the drawers are the page project's, which is exactly what they should be.

 * steps through projects, and a box that blinked out on each press dropped whatever was typed in the gap.
 * The stand-in holds the box's place for the rest — a project the poll has not seen open — so the column

 * agrees — or comes back, if REAPPEAR_MS pass and the thread is still in its queue.
 *
 * "STILL IN ITS QUEUE" MEANS ACCORDING TO A READ THAT STARTED AFTER THE ACTION. A card came back on a poll
 * that had left before Mark as done reached the server and landed after REAPPEAR_MS — one took 25s on a
 * loaded server — and it then stayed until the next read landed (maintainer 2026-09-30: "it reopened for
 * a long time"). Such a read cannot know about the action, so it cannot overrule it: the card stays gone
 * until a read that started after the action (after it LANDED, for a send) has come back, and only that
 * read's verdict brings it back. `readAt` is when the newest read STARTED (lib/projectsQueuesRead.ts).
 *
 * A SEND'S CLOCK STARTS WHEN IT LANDS. A reply is not in when it is typed: a cold session resume, a
 * contention retry (lib/eagerComposerSubmission.ts withDeliveryRetry, ~6s of backoff on its own) or a
 * slow provider can hold the request for longer than REAPPEAR_MS, and a clock started at the click then
 * brought the card back — the handoff, with no sign of the reply — while the message was still on its
 * way, only for it to leave again seconds later once the worker picked it up (maintainer 2026-09-30: "I
 * see the same card reappear without the response, then it goes away again a few seconds later and
 * starts working"). So a sent card stays gone while its request is open, and the reappear window opens
 * when it lands: from there, the thread still resting after REAPPEAR_MS is real news. A failed send
 * brings the card back at once (`restore`), with the text in its box.
 *
 * Keyed by `threadKey` (project + slug), never by slug: this page holds several projects' threads, and
 * a slug is unique only within one.
