// height, then TodosView UNMOUNTS it and adjusts the viewport (user dismissal → auto-scroll the next
// card to the top; board departure → pin a visible neighbour so nothing on screen shifts). There is

            view made to its own ask row on 2026-08-02, arrived at here two surfaces later.
            They sat pinned ABOVE the transcript until 2026-09-05, on the reasoning that a turn parked
            mid-tool_use has "no message to sit under". That premise is only true of an empty thread. In
            every real occurrence the agent had already been working for a while, so the gate rendered
            above the human's OWN opening prompt: a "Run a command?" card asking to approve work whose
            reason sat 22 tool calls below it, and a screenshot of exactly that (maintainer 2026-09-05:
            "the ask-permission prompts are showing up before my initial message that spawned the
            thread"). A gate is the NEWEST thing on the card, like every other trailing control, and it
            is unreadable anywhere but next to the command that provoked it.
            The relative order within the group is unchanged — answerable interactions, then the
            terminal-bound safety nets, then what the policy already refused — and it matches the thread
            view's ladder, where the ask row precedes the pending-ask/perm-prompt rungs.
            HELD UNTIL THE TRANSCRIPT LOADS, for the tail cards' own reason below, and one of its own:
            these carry BUTTONS. Drawn under the "Loading…" line they paint, then jump a full transcript
            height when the messages mount above them — with Grant/Deny moving out from under a cursor

                nothing answerable to offer, so the only way through is the operator's own terminal.
                A pending typed interaction falsifies that outright — InteractionStack drew the request
                right above with its real buttons — so BOTH nets stand down on it rather than telling
                someone to go and type at a session they can resolve with one click.
                It used to be only the AskUserQuestion net that stood down; the perm-prompt banner below
                it did not, and a broker-path escalation sets `runtime: "perm-prompt"` AND journals an
                answerable interaction, so the pair drew together — a "Run a command?" card with
                Grant/Deny, and directly under it "respond in your external terminal" (visible in the
                maintainer's 2026-09-05 screenshot, under the placement defect above).
                `pendingInteraction`, NOT `actionableInteraction`: the question is whether a card is on
                SCREEN, and an answered request stays pending-and-readable while its delivery drains.
                Both nets still cover what they exist for — a pre-contract, adopted or foreign session
                that reaches the tool with no broker to intercept it, and any escalation

                own 2px pitch instead of the 6px hang. With pt-1.5 in that case the ⤷ agent row sat 6px
                off the ⤷ shell row beneath it while the shell rows sat 2px apart from each other —
                three times the pitch, inside one column of identical rows, which read as a group break
                that means nothing (maintainer 2026-07-30). MEASURED in queue-ops-spacing-fixture:
                6/2/2 before, 2/2/2 after. The drawer never had the split — it renders agents and
                shells inside ONE BackgroundOpsStrip, so its column has always been a flat 2px. */}
