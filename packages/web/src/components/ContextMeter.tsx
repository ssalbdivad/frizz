// HOW FULL THE SESSION'S CONTEXT IS — "◔ 74% context", in a thread header's second line after "Last
// active" (queue card, drawer, full-screen), rendered once here so the three cannot drift. It sat as a
// bare donut in the lifecycle footer until 2026-10-05, when the footer went and the context reading
// moved to the header with the other whole-thread facts (maintainer: "we say last active two minutes
// ago, context at 74% or something" — see ThreadLifecycle.tsx for the top/bottom split).
//
// It is a READING, never an estimate. Both halves of the fraction are measured by the provider and
// travel together on ThreadView.context; the server omits the field entirely unless it has both, so
// this component's only job is to render nothing when it is absent. There is deliberately no 0% dial,
// no empty ring, no "—" placeholder: an absent reading must occupy no space at all, the same rule the
// child row's working-duration follows. (Which threads have one, and why, is documented on
// FoldState.contextWindow — the short version is that codex always does, and a Claude thread does from
// its first assistant record, borrowing the window this frizz process last measured for its own model
// alias until its own turn ends and names one.)
//
// THE DENOMINATOR IS THE ROOM THIS THREAD HAS, NOT THE MODEL'S SIZE, and on a Claude thread those are
// routinely different numbers. Frizz dispatches at the 1M window and then caps the worker at Settings'
// compaction window (500K by default), and Claude Code's effective window is the `min` of the two — so
// this dial read "253,862 of 1,000,000 tokens · 25% full" for a session that had used half its room and
// was heading for a summary (maintainer 2026-09-01: "it's showing this even though the auto-compaction
// threshold is currently set to 500k"). The lowering happens once, server-side, in
// ClaudeRuntimeIngest.contextWindow. Do not add a second number here to explain the first: the
// Settings drawer's "Compaction window" field is where that ceiling is named and changed.
//
// SIZE IS INHERITED, NOT SET. The svg is sized in `em` and the arc colors come from `currentColor`, so
// the header line's own text scale decides how big this is and what tone it takes — exactly the
// discipline ChildOpRow's duration reading landed on. Do not put a px size on it.
//
// THE PERCENT IS ON THE SURFACE; THE TOKEN COUNTS ARE IN THE HOVER PANEL. In the footer the dial stood
// alone — a control strip had no room for a background reading's words, and a bare "87%" beside it was
// tried and dropped. The header line is a line of facts in words ("Last active 2m ago"), so the reading
// joins it as one ("74% context") and the dial becomes its glyph. "348,950 of 1,000,000 tokens" stays in
// the panel: it is the detail, not the reading.
//
// So if you are here because a thread appears to have NO indicator: the surface is almost certainly not
// the reason. All three surfaces render this same component, and the answer is per-THREAD — the drawer
// cannot show a reading the queue card would have shown. A Claude row is blank when frizz has no
// denominator for it at all: nothing in this process has yet measured a window for that model alias,
// and the thread has not finished a turn of its own. That was every freshly dispatched thread until
// 2026-08-26 (maintainer: "the context breakdown is often not visible in the drawer view, which I find
// quite odd") — see ClaudeRuntimeIngest.contextWindow for what closed it and why the borrow is a
// measurement rather than a guess.

// Geometry for a 16-unit viewBox donut. r + half the stroke is the OUTER edge, held at 7.5 so the ring
// sits fully inside the box — thinning the stroke therefore RAISES r rather than shrinking the glyph.
//
// STROKE IS MATCHED TO ITS NEIGHBOURS, not chosen. In the footer this dial sat between two lucide
// glyphs drawn with a 1.0px line, and the old strokeWidth 2 painted 1.575px at that 12.6px size — half
// again as heavy, which made a three-glyph status cluster read as three different families (maintainer
// 2026-08-04: "the icon brightnesses and spacing look absolutely terrible"). 1.25 painted 0.98px there.
// In the header it renders at 1.05em of 11px (11.55px), where the same 1.25 paints 0.9px — a pen the
// weight of the regular-weight words beside it rather than a bolder mark. Colour was never the whole
