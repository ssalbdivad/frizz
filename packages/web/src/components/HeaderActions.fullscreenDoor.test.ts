// THE WAY OUT OF FULLSCREEN, AND NO WAY IN ON THE STRIP.
//
// The /full page's header carries the door CLOSING (CollapseThreadLink, ⤡) in the thread's action strip.
// The door OPENING was a ⤢ on every queue card and list row, and in the drawer header, until 2026-09-28
// (maintainer: "the single thread view is only marginally useful at best and should probably be a
// dropdown option"): it is the drawer menu's "Open fullscreen" now (ThreadMenu.tsx), so no strip offers
// a way in.
//
// Before 2026-09-02, /full's way out was an ArrowLeft sitting BEFORE THE TITLE, at the header's far
// left: a second, unrelated place to look for a whole-thread verb, and a "previous page" glyph on a
// control whose job is to change how this thread is SHOWN.

// STALLED, so the strip's far-right verb (Retry) is on the other side of the door. Most of the strip
// gates itself away in a bare render — Reload plugins and Restart worker want a dev build and a live
// broker process, and both simply return null here — so a harness that does not deliberately put
// NEIGHBOURS on both sides of the door cannot tell a position apart from a presence. (It did not:
// moving the closing half to the head of the strip left every reading identical, and the first version
// of the slot test below passed the control that was meant to break it.)
