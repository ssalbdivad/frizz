// RE-TITLE THIS THREAD FROM ITS OPENING REQUEST — the small refresh mark that appears to the right of
// a thread's title when you point at it. Rendered beside the name by ThreadTitle — the one title
// element the thread header (ChatView) and the project board's queue card header (TodosView) shared
// until that board went on 2026-09-28, so the two surfaces could not drift; the queue used to have no
// rename affordance at all (maintainer 2026-08-26: "it should show up in the cue card, in addition to
// showing up in the drawer"). The cross-project card (AllQueuesCard) renders neither, so today only the
// drawer and /full offer it.
//
// A RELOAD MARK, NOT SPARKLES, and REVEALED ON HOVER rather than always drawn (same maintainer, same
// day: "it should be a reload icon, not the sparkles icon for refreshing the title… it should not
// always be visible"). The sparkle said "AI did something here", which is not the question the operator
// has — they want the title recomputed, and that is a refresh. `RotateCw` rather than the `RefreshCw`
// the Restart worker verb wears: the two now sit in the same header bar, and one glyph must not mean
// both "regenerate this name" and "replace this process".
//
// `opacity`, never `hidden`: a control removed from the layout cannot be tabbed to, and it would also
// make the title jump sideways as the pointer arrives. It stays revealed while the request is in
// flight and while an error is still being shown, so the spinner and the failure do not vanish the
// instant the pointer leaves.
//
// EVERY CLICK ANSWERS. Where the verb genuinely cannot run — no live daemon to ask — the click says so
// in a toast instead of doing nothing at all, which is what the old gate did on every running thread.

        // square, so this mark carries 7px of dead space a side. Untrimmed, `gap-1` measured 11.22px
        // of clear space to the title — wide enough that the mark floated free of the name it belongs
        // to, which is the failure the transcript chevron was fixed for (lib/transcriptMetaLabels.ts).
        // Trimmed, it reads as the title's own handle at 8.22px, the distance that pairing already
        // uses. The trim overlaps the hover square 7px into the title's box; only one of the two can
        // paint a fill at a time and this element is later in the DOM, so it wins the pointer there.

        // `-my-3` is the vertical trim, and it is what keeps the 24px hover square from GROWING the
        // title row it rides on: a margin box of zero height contributes nothing to the row, and
        // `items-center` still centres the square on the title's own line box. Without it the row was
        // 24px tall against a 15px title's 18.75px line (leading-tight) — which pushed the "Last active"
        // line 2.6px down in the thread header and made that header 52.75px beside a 48px file viewer
        // (2026-09-03, "headers should have consistent height"), and grew the queue card's title row by
        // 3.4px the same way. The square now overhangs the line by ~2.6px a side, into empty band.
