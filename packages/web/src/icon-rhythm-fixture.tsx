// The measuring surface for the OPTICAL rhythm of frizz's icon strips — the thread HEADER's action
// row and the composer's right rail. Both are clusters of small marks whose CSS spacing is uniform and
// whose PERCEIVED spacing was not, because every glyph wears a different amount of dead padding inside
// its box (maintainer 2026-08-04: "I'm sure the spacing is consistent in terms of the CSS, but what
// matters here is the visual spacing"). A third strip, the thread lifecycle footer, was measured here
// until 2026-10-05, when it went: its snooze and mark-as-done verbs joined the header strip after a
// rule, and its goal joined the thread composer's rail — both rendered below.
//
// The header strip joined on 2026-08-26, when Reload plugins and Restart worker moved up out of the
// footer into it ("the restart worker button should be at the top") and the AI-rename refresh appeared
// beside the title. A verb that changes strips changes rhythm, so both ends are rendered here.
//
// It renders the REAL components, never a mock-up of them, so `scripts/ink-gaps.mjs` measures the
// shipping geometry. Both strips are here together deliberately: they are the same problem, and a
// fix that squares one while leaving the other is the failure this fixture exists to catch.
//
// The gate mocks below are the price of that: three of the controls hide themselves unless the
// server answers, and a fixture missing half the strip measures a rhythm the app never draws.

// Match the application's sans UI; only code and terminal output use monospace.
