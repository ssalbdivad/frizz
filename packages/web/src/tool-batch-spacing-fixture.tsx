// Browser QA for the TOOL-ROW RHYTHM (maintainer 2026-07-27: "there's a bigger gap between independent
// batches as opposed to within a batch"). The invariant: two adjacent tool cards sit at the SAME pitch
// whether they were batched inside one assistant message or split across successive ones — the tailer
// chunks a burst of calls arbitrarily, so the chunking must be invisible.
//
// The transcript below deliberately mixes every chunking shape in one column, so a single measurement
// pass over `.frizz-bash` cards catches any boundary that reads wider than the intra-batch run:
//   • a 3-call batch in ONE message (intra-batch pitch, the reference)
//   • a following message that is ONE call (batch boundary)
//   • a following message that is a 2-call batch (batch boundary + intra)
//   • a message whose parts are text-then-tools (a "let me check:" lead-in) after a tool-only message
//   • a message with TWO tools parts separated by nothing renderable
// Prose / user-bubble adjacency is included as the CONTROL: those boundaries must KEEP their STEP.
