// THIS APP RENDERS IN TWO FONTS and every TEXT mark here (the "?" and the "!") carries a different ink
// position in each — a fixture that never sets `data-font` silently measures the MONO default, which is
// how the "?" came to ship with a nudge fitted in a font the maintainer does not use. `?font=sans`
// measures the other one; both readings live beside the constant in Sidebar.tsx.
document.documentElement.dataset.font = new URLSearchParams(location.search).get("font") === "sans" ? "sans" : "mono"

// EVERY RAIL STATUS MARK, side by side, drawn by the REAL <ThreadIndicator/> — the measuring surface for
// scripts/verify-rail-status-glyphs.mjs. The rail is a checkbox family (one 15px rounded box, a
// different mark inside per state), and a family only reads as one when the marks carry comparable
// optical WEIGHT. That is a pixel question no DOM measurement can answer, so the marks have to render
// somewhere a screenshot can reach them, isolated from row titles and hover affordances.
//
// It renders the shipped component rather than a mock-up on purpose: a reconstruction drifts from the
// thing that ships, and this exists precisely to catch a mark that is wrong in the app.
