// Browser QA for HOW MANY PLACES ONE BACKGROUND SHELL IS DESCRIBED IN. It used to be two: a row under
// the prompt box, and a line in the footer eye's menu naming the same shell by a runtime handle that
// appears nowhere else — which read as two unrelated things ("shells are not watchers… I don't see
// either of them as background shells underneath the prompt box", then "we do not need to redundantly
// list out background shells inside of the watcher icon menu", maintainer 2026-08-14).
//
// It is now ONE: the shell's own row, blue dot and all. This surface rendered the strip AND the lifecycle
// footer together, because the property under test was what the two said about the same shell at the
// same time; the footer itself went on 2026-10-05 (its verbs moved to the header), so the strip is the
// one place left and this surface renders it alone.
//
// `?case=` picks the state. `?font=sans|mono` sets `data-font`, because this app renders in two type
// stacks and a line that fits on one can wrap on the other.
