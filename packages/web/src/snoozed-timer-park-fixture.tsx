// Browser QA for the BAND a declared park lands in, over the REAL <Sidebar/> and the real
// sectionThreads — which is what snoozed-rows-fixture cannot show, since that one hands SectionHeader and
// ThreadRow their rows already sorted. Every row here carries `awaitingBackground: true` the way
// board.ts sets it on a parked ```awaiting fence, because that flag is the whole bug: hasLiveOps read it
// as "its own dispatched work is still live", which stopped being what it means when a timer park
// started setting it (2026-08-24, f50f9e60). The timer row banded ACTIVE, which is the band for a thread
// with something in flight (maintainer 2026-08-26: "showing up in a separate rail that isn't held").
//
//   RESTED (the queue — one row per card)
//     D  QUEUED wait on a registered timer     → hourglass   (2026-09-07; wore the blue dot)
//   HELD (dimmed, labeled — the park band)
//     A  armed future timer, nothing else out   → hourglass   (THE CHANGE; was in Active)
//   ACTIVE (no queue card, something in flight)
//     B  live background shell behind the fence → blue dot    (unchanged — own work is never dimmed)
//     C  registered PR watcher, CI green        → octocat     (unchanged — a handoff must stay visible)
//
// A is the row that MOVED. B and C are the two OTHER parks the same flag describes, and they are the
// controls: the carve-out is `parkedOnRegistrationAlone`, so anything else behind the fence keeps the row
// out of Snoozed exactly as before.
//
// D joined on 2026-09-07 and is the row the maintainer actually sees most: a timer park QUEUES
// (board.deriveNeedsYou keeps it a visible handoff), so it sits in the cue with a card behind it, and
// there it wore the pulsing dot — groups.restingOnLiveBackgroundWork counted an armed timer as motion
// ("an item in the queue that's awaiting a timer should show up with the hourglass icon in the sidebar,
// not with the flashing blue dot"). No fence on D, deliberately: `mcp__frizz__timer` then a bare rest
// is the shape the worker contract steers toward, and the one with nothing but the registered row to read.

// The timer's own instant is computed at load so the wake always sits in the future.
