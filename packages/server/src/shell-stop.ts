// runtime budget (scheduler SOURCE 13, shell-budget.ts). They lived as one set of closures inside the
// router until the budget needed the same kill from the scheduler (2026-09-29), and a second copy would
// have been a second place to forget the notice — the half the provider does not do for us, whose
// absence left a worker waiting on a watcher frizz had already killed. So the closures moved here, and
// the only thing a caller chooses is the REASON the worker is told.

// injects a `<task-notification>` user record the model reads and acts on ("the sub-agent was stopped

// notice itself. Shell-only, deliberately: adding one on the sub-agent path would say it twice.
