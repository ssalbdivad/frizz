// The placement rule's whole arc, because the contract has now taught five different things here and a

// in a row": register-then-refence drew two cards, so the rule was "never also fence it". (2) The same
// afternoon the maintainer reversed it ("it kind of makes sense to me for the agent to decide where
// questions render in its own rest message"), and the fence became the PLACEMENT. (3) 2026-08-30 the
// maintainer retired placement ("Retire mid-prose placement" — measured: 15 of 17 real markers sat at
// the tail where the card lands anyway, 2 of 3,005 transcripts couched one mid-prose). (4) 2026-09-11 the
// FREE-FORM fence was retired outright — `ask` had been "better than a fenced block" since 2026-08-26
// while the contract went on teaching the fence, so workers wrote fences on every day from 2026-08-25 to
// 2026-09-11, and nothing tracks a fence's answer — and the empty placement marker came BACK with it,
// because a marker references a ROW: nothing about a question's lifecycle is guessed from prose. (5)
// 2026-09-28 the marker went again, for good reason this time: taught to place the card "after the
// paragraph that sets it up, before the one that says what happens either way", workers put prose under
// it — 7 of 15 real markers — and the maintainer: "questions should always appear at the bottom of the
// thread not in the middle any explanation should occur beforehand". The card draws itself at the bottom
// of the handoff, the contract teaches writing the explanation FIRST, and it must still teach the
// withdrawal — a question left out of the write-up is still open and still gates `done`. (6) 2026-10-06
// the contract stopped claiming the marker "draws nothing": the web never stopped rendering it (its
// questionShadow.ts is upstream's), so the contract says what a marker does and tells the worker to write
// none (plans/upstream-superset.md §3).
