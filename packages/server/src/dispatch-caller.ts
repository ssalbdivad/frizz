// WHO SENT A `dispatch` — the board, or a worker's `spawn_thread` (2026-10-06).
//
// The router checks a WORKER's spawn for another project's checkout (spawn-project.ts) and leaves what the
// human types alone. It told the two apart by `spawnedFrom`, which the shim started sending at bd36deae —
// but a worker's MCP shim is spawned once per session and lives as long as it, so every session started
// before that commit kept dispatching without it, unchecked. @pullfrog-status (session started 16:21, the
// guard landed 16:44) spawned @superset-impl into Home that evening with `/home/ssalb/frizz` in its brief:
// the exact case the guard exists for, missed because the caller was too old to say it was a worker.
//
// The transport says it regardless of the shim's age. Only two clients POST `dispatch`: the board, from a
// browser, and the shim (cc-worker/bin/frizz-mcp.mjs), whose node fetch sends no `Origin` and
// `user-agent: node`. A browser attaches `Origin` to every POST (Fetch spec, even same-origin) and every
// browser's user agent opens `Mozilla/` — app.test.ts keeps a no-Origin same-origin PWA path open, so a
// request counts as a worker's only when BOTH say so: a browser misread as a worker would have the human's
// own words refused. The RPC layer hands a procedure only its input, so app.ts records the caller here for
// the length of the request.
