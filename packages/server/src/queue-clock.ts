// THE QUEUE CLOCK — when each thread ENTERED the queue, which is what the queue is ordered by.
//
// The queue used to order by the agent's rest time (`lastAssistantAt`), on the theory that a thread
// enters the queue the moment its agent stops talking. That holds for a plain rest and for nothing
// else. A thread that rests BEHIND a wait — a live sub-agent, CI still running on its PR, a declared
// park, an armed timer, the human's own snooze, a stale delivery — sits outside the queue for minutes
// or hours and then enters it without saying another word, carrying the rest time of a turn that
// ended long ago. Under oldest-first that sorted it ABOVE everything the human had been waiting on,
// straight into the card they were reading or answering, and the "queue" behaved like a stack
// (maintainer 2026-09-24: "when a new thread is ready, it moves to the top of the *stack* which can be
// jarring if you're reading/typing input on another thread. make it work like an actual queue"). The
// top-level terminal command threads of the time had it worse: at rest they had no rest time at all, so
// they sorted by when the run STARTED.
//
// So the order key is the enqueue instant itself, observed rather than inferred: the board runs every
// thread through `stamp` on each assembly (the tailer's ~1s nudge plus the 15s reconcile), and the
// clock notices the false→true edge of `needsYou`.
//
//   • A thread keeps its stamp for exactly as long as it stays queued, so nothing that happens to it
//     while it waits — a sub-agent finishing, a label moving, a reader opening it — can move it.
//   • Leaving the queue (the human answers it, snoozes it, marks it done; a wait takes it back) forgets
//     the stamp, so its next entry joins the BACK of the line like any other arrival.
//   • A plain rest — the agent stopped AFTER the last assembly that saw it outside the queue — enters at
//     its rest time, so ordinary arrivals keep the exact order they always had. A thread that rested
//     BEFORE that sighting was held, and entered somewhere between the sighting and now; it is stamped
//     NOW, the late end of that window, because the early end would let it slip ahead of a thread that
//     arrived inside the window and is already on screen — the original bug in miniature.
//
// DURABLE, because the server restarts constantly and the alternative is re-deriving the key from the
// rest time at every boot — which puts every thread that entered off a wait back at the front of the
// line. Session rows persist it (`session.queued_at`). (Terminal command threads persisted their own in
// `command_thread.queued_at` until 2026-09-29, when a terminal stopped being a thread: one waiting at a
// prompt now queues the thread it belongs to, on that thread's stamp.)
//
// AN UNKNOWN READING IS NOT A DEPARTURE. The board starts before the tailer, and the tailer primes at
// most 25 rows a tick, so for the first seconds after a boot every row it has not reached yet has no
// telemetry, or a half-built state it has not folded a transcript into — and a headless row read off
// either is `running`, out of the queue. Taking that at
// face value would clear every stored stamp and send the whole queue to the back in prime-batch order on
// every restart. So the board says which readings it can vouch for (`known`), and only a KNOWN reading
// outside the queue clears a stamp or counts as having seen the thread out. An unknown one changes
// nothing: the stamp waits for the thread's first real reading, and the thread keeps SHOWING queued at it
// meanwhile — a queue that blinked empty for the seconds of a prime moved every card on the reader's screen.
// Symmetrically, a reading the board drew from a STAND-IN with no stamp does not enter the queue unless it
// is urgent (2026-09-30): the stamps are durable, so their absence is the queue's membership as of the last
// server, and it holds until a real reading says otherwise.
//
// A STORED STAMP IS CHECKED ONCE, the first time its thread reads as queued after a boot: if the agent
// has spoken since it (a rest newer than the stamp), the thread left and re-entered while this server was
// not watching, and the stamp is refused for a fresh one. After that the stamp simply holds — a thread
// can be queued MID-TURN (a permission prompt, its terminal at a prompt), and whatever its
// agent or process writes while it waits must not move it.
//
// A RESTART IS A GAP IN THE SIGHTINGS, and the clock bridges it with one durable instant: when the last
// server was still watching (`alive`). It is written only after an assembly in which EVERY durable
// thread had a known reading — so each was either queued (and stamped) or seen outside the queue — and at
// most every ALIVE_EVERY_MS. A durable thread with no stored stamp was therefore outside the queue as of
// that instant, and after a boot it is the thread's last sighting out: one that rested since is a plain
// rest and keeps its rest time, and one that rested before it was held and let go while nobody was
// watching — a snooze that ran out overnight — joins the back like any other release instead of the
// front. A boot that dies before it has read every thread writes nothing, so the instant the next boot
// reads is never one that vouched for rows it had not seen. A row that never gets a known reading holds
// the instant where it was, which errs toward the rest time; so does the first boot after this landed,
// which has no instant at all and keeps exactly the order the queue had before the clock existed.
//
// A RELEASE WAITS ITS TURN TO BE WOKEN. Most holds end in a wake: a sub-agent's return re-invokes its
// parent, CI settling fires the PR watcher, a timer or a park's deadline delivers its prompt. The hold
// lets go first and the wake usually lands seconds later, so for that gap the thread sat in the queue — a
// card flashing in at the bottom and a desktop notification for a thread nobody needed to touch. So an entry
// off a hold is WITHHELD for SETTLE_MS (maintainer 2026-09-24, choosing it: "Hold a released thread out
// for ~12s"): a worker that wakes inside it never reaches the queue, and one that does not enters at the
// back when the window closes, stamped at that instant. The board reads `needsYou` as false meanwhile,
// so it neither notifies nor draws the card, and `queueSettling` tells the client no park stands. A wake
// the scheduler DEFERS (its quiet window after a recent handoff holds one for minutes) is not waited for:
// the thread goes in when the window closes, exactly as it did before there was a window. Only an entry
// off a PARK counts — the last known sighting out of the queue found the thread at rest, with the same
// rest it has now, behind a hold something wakes it from (the board's `parked`) — so an ordinary rest,
// whose last sighting out was its own running turn, is never delayed. Nor is a snooze lifted BEFORE its
// deadline: that was a person (Wake now), and nothing is coming to wake the thread — the bump a snooze may
// carry fires at the deadline, not when it is lifted. And an URGENT reading enters at once whatever held
// it: a permission prompt, a question, a crash, a limit pause.
//
// A THREAD ONLY LOSES ITS PLACE WHEN A PERSON ACTS ON IT (David 2026-09-28, choosing it: "Keep its
// place"). A thread already waiting in line is often re-woken by its own work — a shell finishing, a PR
// watcher, a child's report — and rests again with nobody having touched it. By the rules above that was a
// departure and a fresh arrival, so the card being read (a 2FA question, on 2026-09-24) vanished and came
// back at the bottom. So a departure the human did not cause leaves a claim on the old place, and an entry
// that finds its claim unbroken takes the place back. Everything a person does to a queued thread breaks
// it, through one of three channels the board can see:
//   • a HOLD the human made, seen on any reading out of the queue (`humanOut`): a snooze, done, the resting
//     card's event-snooze, or a follow-up still in the delivery ledger. Every follow-up passes through the
//     ledger and the router re-assembles the board the moment it writes one, so no message the human sends
//     can slip past unseen — which is why this reads the ledger rather than the transcript, where a wake
//     frizz delivers is a user turn exactly like one the human typed;
//   • a GATE only the human's own reply clears, on any reading while the thread waited IN the queue
//     (`humanGate`): a permission prompt, a native ask, a request in the interaction journal — the gate
//     ending is the human answering it;
//   • a REGISTERED QUESTION that stops being open, at any reading from its entry to its return: answered
//     (or withdrawn — the two look alike from here, and erring toward the back is the safe side). A NEW
//     question is not a person acting, so a thread that wakes itself and asks one keeps its place.
// A claim is memory only. It lasts from one departure to the next entry — seconds to minutes — and a
// restart between the two costs the place, which is where the thread would have gone without it.

// How long an entry off a park is withheld (see the header): one scheduler tick (10s) for a wake to be
// sent, plus delivery.
