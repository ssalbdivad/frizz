// WHERE FRIZZ'S MACHINE-GLOBAL STATE LIVES.
//
// `~/.frizz` is not idiomatic anywhere: Linux has had the XDG base directories for a decade, Windows
// has LocalAppData, macOS has Application Support. But an existing install cannot be relocated — this
// tree reaches gigabytes (measured: 1.8 GB of promoted artifacts and 1.5 GB of browser profiles
// against 28 MB of actual thread state), agents hold live file descriptors into it, and the threads
// have no backup anywhere else. So: DETECT first, and only choose for a machine that has never run
// Frizz.
//
//   1. `~/.frizz` exists  -> use it for everything, unchanged, forever. Nobody migrates.
//   2. otherwise         -> the platform's idiomatic locations, XDG variables honored individually.
//
// A `~/.frizz` that is plainly a project BOARD — `threads/` and no data-root file — is not an install
// and does not count (isStrayBoard, below). Nor does one that never held a registry while the platform
// root already does (supersededByInstall, below): rule 1 exists to keep an install from moving, and
// honoring that directory is what would move one.
//
// The three roots exist because the content genuinely differs in kind, which is the whole point of
// the XDG split: `cache` is regenerable and safe to delete (artifacts, browser profiles, quota
// snapshots — the gigabytes), `data` is the threads and cannot be recovered, `state` is logs, locks
// and launch bookkeeping. On a legacy install all three collapse to `~/.frizz` and every historical
// path stays byte-identical.
//
// There is deliberately NO `runtime` root, and the reason is worth stating because XDG says there
// should be one.
//
// `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR` (`/run/user/<uid>`, mode 0700, wiped at logout) is exactly right for locks and
// sockets. But it exists only on Linux, and only when a session manager set it. macOS has no
// equivalent, so a portable rule has to fall back to `$TMPDIR` — and that is where the platforms
// stop agreeing:
//
//   · macOS  `$TMPDIR` is `/var/folders/…/T`, PRIVATE to one user (drwx------).
//   · Linux  `$TMPDIR` is normally unset, so it means `/tmp`: world-writable, SHARED by every account.
//
// One rule, two security properties. Frizz's launch lock and port reservations are machine-global
// mutexes, and putting them in a shared `/tmp` breaks them in a way that does not self-heal, because
// of how staleness is decided: `pidIsAlive` (project-identity.ts) probes `process.kill(pid, 0)` and
// treats EPERM as ALIVE — correct within one account, where EPERM means "running, just not signalable
// by me". Across accounts EPERM is also what you get for someone else's process, so another user's
// abandoned lock reads as permanently held. Nobody can reclaim it, and every launch on that machine
// blocks on a PID it has no business waiting for. A 0700 `/tmp/frizz` from whoever got there first
// fails even earlier, with EACCES.
//
// So locks live in `state`, which is under the user's own home (or their `$XDG_STATE_HOME`) and is
// therefore per-user by construction — the one property the runtime dir was wanted for. The only
// thing given up is the OS wiping them at reboot, which Frizz does not need: it already ages locks out
// itself, by PID plus process-start generation.
//
// Sockets, the other thing a runtime root would serve, already solve this for themselves.
// `claude-broker-host.ts` hashes them into `$TMPDIR` as `frizz-claude-<16 hex of sha256(stateDir,
// sessionId)>.sock` — unique per state directory, so two accounts cannot collide even in a shared
// `/tmp`, and short, which is mandatory: a unix socket path cannot exceed ~104 bytes on macOS, and a
// nested XDG path plus a session UUID would blow straight through that.

 * Resolve Frizz's global roots — ONCE per process for any given home and environment.
 *
 * An explicitly SET XDG variable wins on every platform, including macOS and Windows — a developer
 * who has configured XDG has asked for it and should get it. Everything else follows the platform.
 *
 * WHY THE ANSWER IS MEMOISED, and why that is a correctness rule rather than a speed-up. Resolution
 * reads the FILESYSTEM (does `~/.frizz` exist, does it hold a registry, does the platform root), and
 * production asks for these paths on every registry lookup — `registryPath(home = homedir())` lands
 * here per call, and the server's tenant router reads the registry on every `/_frizz/<project>/…`
 * request. Re-resolving each time meant a running server's data root was whatever the disk said at
 * that instant. On 2026-10-02 a test harness wrote a `registry.json` into a debris `~/.frizz`; the
 * live server's very next lookup took that file for a legacy install, moved its data root onto it,
 * found none of its own projects there, and answered 404 to every worker's `/_frizz/<project>/rpc/…`
 * call. ad124bae stopped the harness choosing that directory; this stops ANY later write from moving a
 * process that has already chosen, and the pin above carries the choice across a server restart. A
 * Frizz moves between roots only when its whole process tree restarts, which is also the only point at
 * which every daemon, descriptor and env var it handed out is re-derived together.
 *
 * The memo is KEYED on every input the decision depends on (memoKey) — never a single process-wide
 * slot, because a process legitimately resolves more than one home: `prepareSandbox` (src/launcher.ts) swaps $HOME before first use and still resolves
 * the operator's real cache under the real home; tests resolve a fresh temp home per case. Each of
 * those is its own key and gets its own answer, frozen from the first time that key was asked.
 *
 * Caching "no install yet" cannot strand a fresh machine's first launch. With no `~/.frizz`, the
 * answer is the platform roots whether or not they exist yet (their existence is only ever consulted
 * to OVERRULE a `~/.frizz`, in supersededByInstall), so the memo holds exactly the directories the
 * launch is about to create. The only thing a later disk change could do is make `~/.frizz` appear —
 * the debris case this exists to ignore — and the next process, seeing the registry this one wrote
 * under the platform root, resolves the same platform root (supersededByInstall again). That reasoning
 * holds for a process that WRITES the install. A process that only LOOKS for a server — the VS Code
 * extension host, the desktop app's main process — has no install of its own to stay consistent with,
 * and a frozen answer strands it when the server it is looking for chose differently (a reader that
 * resolved on a fresh machine before debris and the first server appeared found nothing, where the
 * unmemoised code found the server). Those use `frizzPathsNow`.
 *
 * An injected `exists` bypasses the memo: it is a test asking about a hypothetical filesystem, and
 * an answer about one imaginary disk must never be served for a real one, or vice versa.

 * The machine address for the frizz root a given project state dir lives under — `../..` from it.
 *
 * ALWAYS PREFER THIS over the `homedir()` default above. The default reads real machine state, and a
 * server booted inside a test or a sandbox stack would publish (and then, on its clean exit, RETIRE)
 * the address of the maintainer's actual running frizz. That is not hypothetical: it happened on
 * 2026-08-08, when a `startup-transaction.test.ts` run silently deleted `~/.frizz/server.lock` out
 * from under a live server on port 50020, and it looked exactly like a rogue second instance.
 *
 * Deriving it from the state dir instead makes the path follow whatever sandbox the caller is already
 * in, with no new option to thread and nothing to remember. It is also the SAME derivation the worker
 * shim uses (`dirname(dirname(FRIZZ_STATE_DIR))`, cc-worker/bin/frizz-mcp.mjs), so the two cannot
 * disagree about where the address lives.
