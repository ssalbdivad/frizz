// ── A MAILBOX FOR WORKFLOW AGENTS ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Claude Code gives a parent no way to reach an agent running inside a `Workflow`. `SendMessage` looks
// its target up in the session's task table, and a Workflow's agents are run by the workflow and never
// entered there — so the lookup reads the agent as evicted and RESUMES A SECOND COPY from its transcript
// beside the live one (read off the 2.1.287 bundle; seen live 2026-09-29, two writers in one worktree).
// Frizz's own drawer steer cannot reach one either: it rides an input frame the CLI only routes to
// tool_use ids its main thread issued.
//
// Hooks DO reach them. Measured on 2.1.287 (2026-10-06): a PostToolUse hook fires for every tool call
// a Workflow agent makes, its input carries `agent_id` and `agent_type: "workflow-subagent"`, and its
// `additionalContext` reached the agent's model; a SubagentStop hook fires as the agent finishes, and
// `decision: "block"` kept it going with the reason as its next input. So a message is a FILE: whoever
// sends writes it into the agent's mailbox, and the worker plugin's `agent-inbox.mjs` hook hands it to
// the agent after its next tool call, or as it tries to finish.
//
// THE FORMAT IS A CONTRACT WITH `cc-worker/hooks/agent-inbox.mjs`, which reads it and also writes it
// (when it diverts a `SendMessage`). The hook is plain JS because it runs under bare `node` down to the
// engines floor, so the format is two short implementations pinned by one test
// (`agent-inbox-hook.test.ts`), not a shared module:
//
//   <session-dir>/frizz-inbox/<agentId>/<ms>-<hrtime>-<uuid>.json   {"from": "...", "text": "...", "at": <ms>}
//
// Names sort oldest first. The monotonic clock breaks a tie between two messages one sender posted in
// the same millisecond; between two processes in one millisecond the order is arbitrary, and nothing
// a sender could mean depends on it.
//
// One file per message, written to a temp name and renamed in, so a reader never sees half of one. The
// reader claims each file by renaming it, so two hooks firing at once for parallel tool calls cannot
// both deliver it. The session dir is the one Claude Code keeps beside the session transcript
// (`<transcript without .jsonl>/`), which both sides can find without knowing anything of Frizz's.

// ── A RUNNING CHILD'S TIME LIMIT, REWRITTEN FROM OUTSIDE ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// A child's deadline is worked out once, by its own hook, and kept in `<session-dir>/frizz-deadlines/
// <agentId>.json` (cc-worker/hooks/agent-deadline.mjs `agentDeadline`); its stage markers and its intro
// marker sit beside it. A child dispatched before its thread had a limit therefore cached "none" and never
// heard of one set later (2026-10-08: 12 children ran on unaware while their 4 parents handed off). So when
// the USER sets a thread's limit, the server rewrites that file for each running child — the hook then
// introduces the limit after the child's next tool call and runs its check-ins against it. Same format as
// the hook writes, plus `setBy: "user"`, which the hook's introduction reads; agent-inbox-hook.test.ts pins
// the pair. A child already due sooner keeps its own limit.
