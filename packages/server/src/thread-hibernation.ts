// Idle-thread hibernation — reclaim the memory a RESTING worker holds, without ending it.
//
// A frizz worker is expensive at rest and free to restart. Measured on the maintainer's machine
// 2026-08-19 (64 GB, 38 live worker threads, ALL 38 idle, 19 GB held): 504 MB per thread all-in —
// a `claude` CLI at 289 MB, a chrome-devtools MCP pair at 159 MB, the broker daemon at 39 MB and the
// frizz MCP server at 17 MB. That browser was frizz's own always-on mount, removed 2026-08-26: a
// thread now carries only the MCP servers the PROJECT configured, so the same measurement in a repo
// with no `.mcp.json` would read ~345 MB, and since 2026-10-05 so does one whose `.mcp.json` brings a browser
// until a tool call starts it (lazy-mcp-host.ts) — still the largest reclaimable block on the machine. Seventeen of those threads had been idle for an hour or
// more; the oldest for 19.5 hours, still holding its full 504 MB. Nothing in frizz ever collected them:
// the broker daemon's own IDLE_EXIT_MS is six hours AND only fires when no client is attached, which
// for a frizz-managed thread is never.
//
// SIXTY MINUTES is the threshold because it is the Anthropic prompt-cache TTL. A thread idle longer
// than that has ALREADY lost its cache, so tearing its process down and cold-resuming it later costs no
// extra tokens — the memory saving and the token cost genuinely do not overlap. Below the TTL they do,
// which is why the default is not lower.
//
// The MECHANISM is not new. `killBroker` + the next input's `resume: true` is exactly what a usage-limit
// resume and a permission-mode change already do in production ("Nothing durable is lost — the
// transcript is on disk and `resume: true` reads it back — beyond the in-memory sub-agents"). This
// module is the DECISION: which threads may be torn down unattended, and when.
//
// SAFETY — it fails CLOSED, everywhere, because the two outcomes are not comparable. A thread wrongly
// left running costs 504 MB of a 64 GB machine. A thread wrongly hibernated destroys whatever the
// maintainer had in flight: the in-memory sub-agents die with the process, a turn mid-tool-call is lost
// with no record of what it was doing, and an approval the daemon is parked on can never be answered.
// So every unknown — no telemetry, no transcript, an unparseable timestamp, an enumeration that threw —
// is a REFUSAL to hibernate, and the predicate below is the union of every "this thread is busy"
// reading frizz already has rather than the minimum that would look sufficient.

// A codex thread has the same 42 MB-per-daemon shape on paper and a different one in fact: ONE
// `codex app-server` daemon serves every codex thread on the machine (three of them held 0.12 GB in the
// same census, against 19 GB for the claude side), so there is no per-thread process to reclaim. The
// per-thread cost that would matter — the model session inside it — has no teardown verb the bridge
// exposes and no `resume: true` equivalent to bring one back on the next input; `resumeOwnedSession`
// re-binds a thread the daemon still holds. Hibernating codex would therefore be a new mechanism, not
// an extension of this one, and it would be aimed at 0.6% of the memory. Left undone on purpose.
