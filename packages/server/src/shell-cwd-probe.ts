// WHERE A RUNNING AGENT SHELL ACTUALLY IS — asked of the OS, because the transcript cannot say.
//
// A shell's start folder was first read off its launch record's `cwd`, adjusted for a leading `cd`
// (tailer.ts shellStartCwd). The first real run showed that reading is wrong exactly when it matters
// (2026-09-29, haiku on an isolated stack). The harness stamps a record's `cwd` when it WRITES the
// record, and it writes a turn's records in a batch. The worker started a shell in the project root,
// then ran `git worktree add … && cd` into the worktree. Every record of that turn, including the first
// shell's launch and the thinking before it, landed stamped with the worktree. So the root shell's row
// said `probe`, the one fact the maintainer asked this surface to get right ("when the agent chooses to
// use a worktree instead of main").
//
// The process knows. The shell holds its own `tasks/<taskId>.output` open as stdout and stderr, which is
// the same fact the liveness probe (tailer.ts probeShellsAlive) asks `lsof` about, and a holder's
// working directory is where the command is running. That includes a `cd` inside the command itself,
// which is the folder a human means by "where it runs". So:
//
//   1. `lsof -F pn -- <paths>` names each path's holders: a `p<pid>` line, then an `n<path>` line per fd.
//   2. The LOWEST pid holding a path is taken as the shell. Its children (a `sleep`, a dev server's
//      workers) inherit the same fds and were spawned after it, and they almost always share its folder.
//   3. That pid's cwd: `/proc/<pid>/cwd` on Linux (a readlink, no process spawned);
//      `lsof -a -d cwd -F pn -p <pids>` on macOS, which has no /proc.
//
// Every uncertain step answers `undefined`, and `undefined` leaves the transcript's reading in place:
// no lsof, a path nobody holds (the shell finished before anyone asked), a process gone between the two
// questions, or Windows (whose probe is an exclusive open, which names no holder). A guess is never
// substituted for either reading.
//
// Only a VETTED path is ever asked about (background-shell-output.ts vetHarnessOutputPath). An agent can
// forge a launch ack naming any file, and the folder of whatever process holds some other file is not a
// fact about this shell.
