 * the bundle again and one that transfers nothing. Until 2026-09-04 this handler sent `content-type`
 * and no validator of any kind, so a reload with the browser cache ENABLED re-fetched the whole app.
 * Measured that day in headless Chrome against a real 558-thread board, document + static bytes on a
 * reload: 1,568,997 -> 1,200, and DOMContentLoaded 34.5 -> 14.2 ms. The 1,200 is three 304s for the
 * files that are NOT hashed; every byte under /assets/ comes from disk.
 *
 * index.html is the opposite case and must never get that treatment: it is the document that NAMES
 * the current hashes, so an immutably-cached copy strands the browser on the old build's asset URLs.
 * Frizz updates itself by promoting a new artifact and restarting, which means "restart and reload"
 * has to be enough to land on the new app — caching the shell would break exactly that. `no-cache`
 * says "store it, but revalidate before every use": the reload still costs ~300 bytes when nothing
 * changed (a 304 off the ETag below) and picks up a new build the moment there is one. Verified by
 * swapping a new entry chunk in under a running server and reloading the same page in the same
