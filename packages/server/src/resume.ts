 * the entire mechanism behind that promise, and every runtime has to honour it.
 *
 * It lives HERE, above `resumeThreadOwned`, because that function only ever served the retired
 * inject-into-a-live-CLI path. A broker-backed Claude row (detached daemon) and an app-server Codex
 * row (bridge) both branch away in the followUp RPC long before it, so while this lived inside
 * `resumeThreadOwned` those two reopened their WORKER without reopening their ROW: the daemon
 * cold-resumed and started executing while the board still read `state='archived'`, which renders the
 * thread as Done and — because an archived thread has no lifecycle verbs — leaves it with no
 * Mark-as-done button to stop it with. Observed
 * 2026-07-31 on a live broker thread: `claude --resume` running for minutes against a row still
 * carrying `exited=1, state='archived'`.
 *
 * Called UP FRONT, above the runtime branches, so a still-LIVE archived thread reactivates too rather
 * than being stranded in Inactive by a delivery path that returns from its own branch. Touch the row only when it is
 * actually archived, so an ordinary live steer emits no needless per-keystroke delta. Session-guarded:
 * a row that was re-dispatched under us is a CAS miss, not a reopen. (The wakers scheduler never
 * reaches this — it filters archived threads out — so this only ever un-hides a thread on an EXPLICIT
 * human bump, never auto-resurrects a deliberately-shelved one.)

/**
 * A follow-up UN-PARKS the thread: reprompting IS re-engagement, so it disables whatever snooze the row

 *
 * This reverses the older rule that a follow-up preserved the park (maintainer 2026-08-03: "reprompting
 * a thread that snoozed should disable the snooze"). That rule read a snooze as a standing display
 * preference — shelve until Friday, and typing into the thread must not drag it out of Snoozed. In practice
 * it does the opposite of what the operator wants: the turn you just sent runs in Active, then re-parks
 * the moment it rests, so the ANSWER to your own prompt drops back out of the queue unseen. A park says
 * "not now"; a follow-up says "now", and the later instruction wins.
 *
 * Nothing is disarmed silently. The park is visible on the row (the sidebar's snoozed sentence) and in
 * the thread (the header's amber snooze clock), so a bump that goes away leaves the surface it lived on
 * empty — and re-arming it is the same two clicks that armed it. `Wake now` remains the un-park verb for
 * an operator who wants the card back WITHOUT sending a turn.
 *
 * Cleared through `setSnoozedUntil(slug, null, null)`, the same call Wake now makes: the instant and the
 * prompt it armed are ONE fact, so dropping the deadline drops the bump with it. Unlike the un-archive
 * above this needs no CAS and aborts nothing — the caller has already proved it owns this session, and
 * refusing a steer over stale park bookkeeping would be worse than the stale row itself.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT reached by the wakers scheduler, which resumes through `resumeThread` directly: a
 * snooze bump must not clear the very park it was fired from (the scheduler settles that itself, guarded
 * on the fence id it armed — see scheduler.ts SOURCE 3).
