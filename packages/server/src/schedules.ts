// ---- SCHEDULED THREADS: THE SERVER HALF ------------------------------------------------------------------
// plans/scheduled-threads.md is the design; this module is all of it that is not storage, the RPC surface
// or the interpreter's model call (schedule-interpreter.ts):
//
//   · create / validate / echo, the per-project cap, update, pause / resume / Turn on, delete, Run now;
//   · the materialized next run — ONE lazy thread per active schedule, snoozed until its occurrence, so
//     the upcoming run sits in the Snoozed band where the human already looks and every per-occurrence act
//     (skip = Mark as done, move = snooze, run now = send, edit = its note) is one they already know (§4);
//   · the scheduler pass, `evalDue` (§6): reconcile the human's acts on the next run, claim an occurrence
//     synchronously with the revision guard, launch it OFF the tick, settle a dead process's claims, cap
//     lateness, skip on overlap, pause on back-pressure / failures / a stuck run, resume on review;
//   · every start of a schedule's lazy row, whoever makes it — so a run the HUMAN sends early still opens
//     with the run header and still lands in the history (`startLazyRow`).
