// THE THREAD'S TIME LIMIT, as the WORKER meets it (plans/time-limits.md). The shared half
// (@frizz/shared deadline.ts) parses what the human typed and places the stages; this half is what the
// worker reads — the section of its system prompt, the check-ins, the notice when the human moves the
// clock — and the one reading of a row's deadline every server reader shares.
//
// Precedent: the background-shell budget (shell-budget.ts, scheduler SOURCE 13) — opt-in, sized by the
// party that knows, reaching the worker mid-turn. A deadline is that one level up: the subject is the
// thread instead of a shell, and the consequence is a handoff instead of a `TaskStop`. Unlike the shell
// budget there is no teeth: nothing is ever stopped (the agent completion invariant), so the whole
// mechanism is what the worker is told and what the board shows.
