// Building one takes most of a second, and almost none of that is Frizz. Measured 2026-10-03 on macOS
// 26.6 against the live server: the request reached the server and spawned the helper in ~0.1s, and the
// dialog then took 0.8-1.0s to draw. The unified log of the operator's own three adds that afternoon
// has the same split: osascript and AppKit up in ~0.18s, then ~0.6s waiting on
// `com.apple.appkit.xpc.openAndSavePanelService`, the separate process every NSOpenPanel is hosted in
// (the private `NSUseRemoteSavePanel=NO` keeps it in-process and saves only ~0.2s). AppleScript's
// `choose folder` and `choose file` cannot be split, so each picker is an NSOpenPanel driven from JXA:
// the helper BUILDS it and then waits on stdin, and a built panel draws 82-94ms after the line that
// shows it arrives.
//
// So the browser asks for a panel as soon as the click it serves is likely — the folder panel when the
// pointer or keyboard focus reaches an "Add a project" control (`warmDirectoryPicker`, through the
// `projectPickWarm` RPC), the image panel when a project's icon menu opens (`warmImagePicker`, through
// `projectIconPickWarm`) — and the click only shows it. A panel nobody shows is killed after
// WARM_PANEL_IDLE_MS, because while it waits it holds ~55 MB of physical footprint — osascript 31 MB
// and its own instance of the panel service 24 MB, both gone with it (`footprint`; RSS reads ~150 MB,
// most of it shared framework pages): fine for a minute, not forever.

 * exits. End of input before that line means nobody is going to ask: it exits without drawing
 * anything, which is also what ends a waiting panel whose server has gone.
 *
 * Each panel keeps the AppleScript dialog it replaced in every visible respect. Both take one item,
 * their button reads Choose, and they float above the browser at the modal-panel level without
 * activating themselves. The folder panel takes folders only and offers New Folder. The image panel
 * takes files conforming to `public.image` — every format the rail accepts, and nothing else — and

// WINDOWS: a WinForms FolderBrowserDialog, opened from a PowerShell child.
//
// Two editions draw two dialogs. `pwsh` (PowerShell 7, .NET 8) draws the modern "Select Folder"
// dialog, with a path box the operator can paste into; Windows PowerShell 5.1 (.NET Framework, on
// every Windows install) draws the old tree, which can only be clicked through. The better one is not
// guaranteed to be installed, so it is tried first and the old one is the fallback, ENOENT deciding.
//
// AND THE DIALOG HAS TO BE RAISED, which is the whole reason this is more than one line. The server is
// a background process — the browser is the foreground one — and Windows refuses a background
// process the foreground, so the dialog opened BEHIND the browser, where nobody saw it, and sat
// there until the timeout killed it: "Add a project" read as doing nothing (measured 2026-09-18 and
// 2026-09-21 on Windows Server 2022; the "Browse For Folder" window was there, below every browser
// window). Topmost is refused the same way: SetWindowPos(HWND_TOPMOST) reports success and the style
// never takes. What works is the AttachThreadInput route: share the foreground thread's input queue
// for the one SetForegroundWindow call, then detach.
//
// The window that gets raised is an OWNER, not the dialog. ShowDialog blocks until the dialog is gone,
// so straight-line script cannot raise the dialog; a timer inside the modal loop can, but it has to
// guess which window is the dialog, and it once guessed the hidden parking window WinForms gives an
// ownerless dialog (seen 2026-09-21 on the deployed server). An owner form needs no guess: it is
// raised BEFORE the dialog opens, and a modal dialog opens on top of its active owner — that is what
// ownership means to the window manager. The form is one pixel, off-screen, and closed with the dialog.
