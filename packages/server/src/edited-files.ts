// THE FILES A THREAD'S WORKER HAS WRITTEN, derived from its projected transcript — the fullscreen
// page's rail lists them (maintainer 2026-08-28: "the edited files, if that's even possible"). Two
// readings feed it:
//
//  1. TOOL CALLS. Every Edit/Write/MultiEdit call carries a structured `edit.file`, and a codex
//     apply_patch the projection could not reconstruct still arrives named Edit with the file as its
//     `detail` — the same two readings the web's toolActivity uses for the "edited N files" digest,
//     kept in step by construction (the same name set, the same fallback order).
//  2. SHELL WRITES. A Bash call's own command text, parsed for redirects and in-place editors
//     (shared/shell-writes.ts). Added 2026-09-04 after a real doc a nub thread authored with
//     `cat > .frizz/sandbox-direction-decisions.md <<'MD'` never reached the rail: Claude Code's
//     `auto` permission mode TELLS the worker to edit with "sed, heredocs, or short scripts, rather
//     than using the dedicated Read, Edit, or Write tools", so on the maintainer's own threads the
//     tool-call reading alone is blind by design, not by worker error.
//
// READING 2 IS THIS RAIL'S ALONE, and that divergence from the digest is deliberate rather than drift:
// it needs the project dir to resolve a relative target and the filesystem to reject one that was never
// written, and the per-turn digest runs in the browser with neither. A count that swept in `/dev/null`
// and every `/tmp` capture would be worse than one that admits what it counts.
//
// It runs over the FULL projection, never the latest window: the window is the last ~300 messages,
// and a worker's edits sit in the middle of an effort with verification and the handoff after them.
// Distinct by path, newest edit first, each with how many write calls touched it and when the last
// one was issued (the emitting message's own stamp).
//
// A FILE THAT NO LONGER EXISTS IS NOT A ROW, whichever reading named it. A Bash `rm`/`mv` is not
// parsed; the rail asks the filesystem at read time instead, which also catches a file deleted by
// another thread, by the maintainer, or by anything else. Until 2026-09-25 an Edit/Write row was kept
// after its file was deleted, as part of "the account of what the effort did" — and two memory files a
// worker wrote under `~/.claude` and then deleted stayed on the rail for good, each row opening a file
// that was not there (maintainer: "These two files keep showing up in the sidebar … despite the fact
// that they've been deleted"). The rail is a way into the files; one that is gone has no way in.
