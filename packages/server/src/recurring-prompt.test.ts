// The stop hook's two SERVER-side invariants (scheduler.ts SOURCE 5), each of which is a way the
// feature could silently loop forever or silently stop:
//
//   1. the fold's sentinel lifecycle — ALLDONE only means "nothing actionable" while it is the FINAL
//      word, so a later message that omits it must re-open the loop by itself;
//   2. the row's GENERATION — editing the text supersedes a bump already queued for the old words,
//      while merely toggling off and on must NOT (that would re-send a bump the operator watched land).
//
// The end-to-end proof that a real agent is bumped at rest, bumped again at its NEXT rest, and left
// alone once it answers ALLDONE lives in backend/_live_recurring_prompt.mts — a live probe, not a unit
// test, because the only thing worth asserting there is what a real worker does.
