// THE SCHEDULE INTERPRETER (plans/scheduled-threads.md §3): ONE short model call that decides whether what
// the human typed into the prompt box asks for its task to REPEAT on a schedule, and if it does, finds the
// schedule in it. The model INTERPRETS; Frizz COMPUTES — it returns an RRULE and a local start, and
// everything the human then sees (the echo, the next runs) is built from that rule by schedule-rule.ts, so
// a mistranslated "9am" shows before it ever runs.
//
// It reads ORDINARY prompts. There is no schedule button and no mode (maintainer 2026-10-06): the box asks
// whenever a prompt holds one of the trigger words (@frizz/shared schedule-trigger.ts), and most such
// prompts are not schedules — "fix the bug from this morning", "why did the nightly build fail?",
// "summarize every PR merged this week". So the first thing the prompt teaches is INTENT: only a request
// that the task itself recur on the clock or calendar is a schedule. A time in the past, a deadline, a set
// the task covers once, software the task builds that runs on a schedule, a single later time, a repeat
// tied to an event, and quoted words are all `no_schedule`. "Change when" (`existing`) is the exception:
// there the whole text is a WHEN by construction.
//
// It does NOT rewrite the prompt. It names the exact phrase it read as the schedule, and the saved prompt
// is the typed text with that phrase cut out, otherwise verbatim: Frizz prompts are often long and careful,
// and a model "distilling" one paraphrases, drops constraints or truncates (critique-ux §4).
//
// The SYSTEM PROMPT IS STATIC; the clock and the zone ride in the user message. That is what lets the
// completer keep a CLI started ahead of the next read (claude-oneshot.ts `spare`, whose options — the
// system prompt among them — are fixed when it starts), and lets a model that caches the prefix reuse it.
//
// Through the same one-shot completer the thread namer uses (backend/claude-oneshot.ts): a throwaway SDK
// session with no tools, no settings, no MCP servers and one turn.
//
// THE MODEL: sonnet, for every read — the live box and Change when alike. Measured with
// scripts/schedule-extract-eval.ts on 2026-10-06 against this prompt (the harness is deleted now that the
// choice is made; `git show 6554d0ea:scripts/schedule-extract-eval.ts` and its fixture restore it): 214
// positives graded on their next 5 runs, 20 Change when texts, 10 one-off times, 88 negatives, and the
// maintainer's 74 past prompts that hold a trigger word; at most 4 reads in flight, load average ~9:
//            same runs  WRONG  missed  Change when  false positives: one-offs, negatives, history   per read
//   haiku    179/214    31     4       16/20        4/10, 1/88, 0/74                               2.06s median, 2.86s p90
//   sonnet   214/214     0     0       20/20        0/10, 1/88, 1/74                               2.96s median, 5.02s p90
// Haiku's wrong schedules are not noise: 35 cases only haiku got wrong, 0 only sonnet (exact McNemar p <
// 0.001). Most start late — a week late for "every Tuesday", the wrong half of "every other Friday",
// tomorrow for a slot still ahead today — and the rest misread intervals and windows ("every hour" as once a
// day, "from 8 to 6" without 6pm); it also scheduled 4 of the 10 one-off times. The "Today counts" line
// below was written for the first of those, and took sonnet from 213 to 214 but haiku only from 175 to 179.
// Sonnet answered identically on a repeat run of the previous prompt (the same one wrong schedule, the same
// two false positives), so its numbers are not the luck of one draw. Its two false positives: "the report
// should go out weekly" (a fair ambiguity) and one past prompt asking what to do "at the beginning of each
// day". The cost is latency, ~0.9s median and ~2s p90 per read at 4 in flight; one read at a time through
// claude-oneshot with its spare, as the box reads, sonnet answers in 1.69s median (claude-oneshot.ts).

export function interpreterSystemPrompt(): string {
  return `You read a prompt someone typed into Frizz, which starts AI agent threads, and decide whether it asks for its task to RUN ON A REPEATING SCHEDULE. Almost every prompt is a task to start now. A schedule is a prompt asking for its task to be done again and again at times on the clock or calendar — "every Monday at 9am triage new issues" — and Frizz then starts a fresh thread with the task at each of those times. You never do the task.

Answer with exactly ONE JSON object and nothing else: no prose, no code fence.

A schedule:
{"phrase": string, "rrule": string, "dtstart": string, "condition": string or null, "title": string}

Not a schedule:
{"refuse": "no_schedule" or "presence", "detail": string}

DECIDE FIRST. Words of time never make a schedule by themselves; only a request that the task itself recur does. Answer no_schedule when the time words:
- describe the past, a deadline, or a thing: "the deploy broke last night", "Monday's release", "have it ready by Friday", "the daily digest email is broken"
- pick out what the task covers, once: "every file in src", "each failing test", "the PRs merged this week"
- describe software the task builds, changes or asks about, even when that software runs on a schedule: "add a workflow that runs nightly", "move the backup job to Sundays", "why does the cron fire hourly?"
- name one later time and no repetition: "Friday at 3pm deploy the release"
- tie the repeat to an event instead of the clock: "every time CI fails, fix it", "after each deploy, run the smoke tests"
- sit inside quotes or code.
Answer "presence" when WHEN depends on the person being at their computer, working or online ("while I'm working", "when I'm at my desk"): Frizz cannot tell that.

When it IS a schedule:

phrase: the words that say WHEN, copied EXACTLY from the text — same characters, same case, one contiguous span, wherever it sits (start, middle or end). Include the words that limit or qualify the schedule ("unless it's a holiday", "for three weeks", "starting Monday"). Never include the task.

rrule: one RFC 5545 RRULE value without the "RRULE:" prefix, using ONLY these parts: FREQ (HOURLY, DAILY, WEEKLY, MONTHLY, YEARLY), INTERVAL, COUNT, UNTIL, BYMONTH, BYMONTHDAY, BYDAY, BYHOUR, BYMINUTE, BYSETPOS, WKST. Never BYSECOND, BYYEARDAY, BYWEEKNO, EXDATE or RDATE.
- ALWAYS give BYHOUR and BYMINUTE (FREQ=HOURLY: always BYMINUTE, and BYHOUR for a window of hours).
- times the text does not give: no time of day is 9am; morning 9am; afternoon 2pm; evening 6pm; night, nightly and tonight 9pm; end of day 5pm. A bare hour with no am or pm: 7 to 11 is am and 12 to 6 is pm, unless a word beside it says otherwise ("at 2 at night" is 2am, "evenings at 8" is 8pm).
- days the text does not give: weekly is Monday; monthly is the 1st; hourly is on the hour.
- weekdays and business days: BYDAY=MO,TU,WE,TH,FR. Weekends: BYDAY=SA,SU.
- the last day of the month: FREQ=MONTHLY;BYMONTHDAY=-1. Never write a BYMONTHDAY above 28 — count back from the month's end with a negative number instead.
- the first weekday of the month: FREQ=MONTHLY;BYDAY=MO,TU,WE,TH,FR;BYSETPOS=1. The last business day: the same with BYSETPOS=-1. The last Friday of the month: FREQ=MONTHLY;BYDAY=-1FR.
- quarters: FREQ=MONTHLY;INTERVAL=3 or FREQ=YEARLY;BYMONTH=1,4,7,10 (or 3,6,9,12 for a quarter's end).
- every other Friday: FREQ=WEEKLY;INTERVAL=2;BYDAY=FR.
- every N minutes: FREQ=HOURLY;BYMINUTE= the minutes that are multiples of N — every 20 minutes is BYMINUTE=0,20,40.
- every N hours within a window: FREQ=HOURLY;INTERVAL=N with BYHOUR listing exactly the hours that run — every 2 hours from 9 to 5 is BYHOUR=9,11,13,15,17.
- several times a day: BYHOUR lists them, sharing one BYMINUTE.
- a limited run ("for three weeks", "until Christmas"): COUNT, or UNTIL as a date YYYYMMDD.
- runs must be at least 15 minutes apart.

dtstart: the FIRST run, as local YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM — the earliest time the rule fires after now, or after the start the text names. Today counts: at 2:32pm on a Monday, "daily at 3pm" first runs today at 3pm, "at 10am and 4pm" today at 4pm, and "every Thursday" this Thursday — never a day or a week later than the rule allows. It anchors INTERVAL: "every other Friday" starts on the coming Friday, "every 3 days at 9am" at the next 9am, "every 4 hours" at the next whole hour. A time named in another zone ("9am Pacific") is converted into this zone.

condition: anything the rule cannot express but the run itself can check when it starts, as a short clause that reads after the rule — "unless it's a US public holiday", "only when a release went out the day before", "only if there are new issues". The rule then fires on every candidate day and the run checks the condition first. null when there is none.

title: one or two words in sentence case naming the task's subject, at most 20 characters — "Triage issues", "Dep bumps", "CI check", "Standup digest". Not a sentence, not a bare verb.
