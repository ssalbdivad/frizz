// ── The durable tail-state cache ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// The tailer's FIRST tick primes every registry row by folding its ENTIRE JSONL from byte 0. On the
// maintainer's own board that is 379MB of JSON.parse across 165 threads — 10-16s of synchronous boot,
// every boot, for transcripts that finished weeks ago and will never change again. It is also the one
// part of boot that is O(all threads x transcript bytes), so it is what breaks at thousands of threads.
//
// This cache removes the RE-read. A thread's derived tail state is a pure left fold over the bytes of
// its transcript, so the state at byte offset N is fully determined by bytes [0, N). Persist that state
// alongside the exact file identity it was folded from, and the next boot can resume the fold at N
// instead of at 0 — reading only what was appended since (usually nothing).
//
// WHAT IT IS KEYED ON — deliberately never "the row says done":
//   * the transcript's INODE          — a replaced/rotated file is a different file, never a hit
//   * its SIZE >= the cached offset   — a shrunk file was truncated; the prefix is not ours
//   * its MTIME                       — recorded, and re-verified below when nothing appears to have moved
//   * a CONTENT digest of the first 1KiB and of the 1KiB ending at the cached offset, so an in-place
//     rewrite that happens to preserve inode+size+mtime still misses
//   * the FOLD SCHEMA digest — a content hash of the modules that DEFINE the derivation. Change how a
//     record folds and every cached state is invalidated automatically, with no version constant to
//     remember to bump. This is the difference between a cache and a silent correctness bug: a thread
//     that never changes again would otherwise keep its pre-upgrade derivation forever.
//
// A thread whose transcript GREW is still a hit: the state resumes at the cached offset and the tailer
// consumes only the delta — the same bytes it would have consumed had the server never restarted.
//
// COLD OR CORRUPT DEGRADES TO SLOW, NEVER TO WRONG. Every read path is wrapped: a missing table, an
// unparseable blob, a schema mismatch, a stat failure, a digest mismatch — all resolve to "no entry",
// which is exactly the pre-cache behaviour (fold from byte 0). Writes are best-effort for the same
// reason; a failed write only costs the next boot its speedup.
