// ── Structured logging, shared by every Frizz process ───────────────────────────────────────────────
// Frizz's readout used to be whatever each subsystem happened to console.log, printed straight to a TTY
// that the launcher, the supervisor and the forked control-plane child all wrote to at once. Two
// consequences, both of which the operator saw every launch: the launcher had to abandon its animated
// progress line the moment the child started talking (it cannot clear another process' output), and a
// crash left nothing behind to read afterwards.
//
// So every record now goes through here. The DISK sink is unconditional and is the complete feed; the
// terminal is a deliberately thin view onto it. `--debug` widens the terminal view back to everything.
//
// Processes share one log FILE, not one writer: each opens it O_APPEND and writes whole lines. POSIX
// guarantees an O_APPEND write smaller than PIPE_BUF lands atomically at the end, so the child and its
// supervisor interleave records without a lock or an IPC hop, and a child that dies mid-write cannot
// truncate what the supervisor already wrote.
