/**
 * The server child's half of SESSION_EPOCH.
 *
 * The session gate lives in the LAUNCHER (the `frizz` package), and an in-app update replaces only this
 * child (the `frizz-server` package): the launcher, its listener and its in-memory signing key keep
 * running. So a launcher that predates an epoch bump never applies it on its own, and a launcher that
 * knows the bump applies it only at its next start. This closes that gap from the child's side:
 *
 *   1. Advance the epoch on disk. That rotates the key FILE, which every launcher (old or new) reads at
 *      its next start, so every session minted before the bump is dead from then on.
 *   2. Ask the running launcher, over loopback, to sign every device out now — the same request as
 *      `frizz --sign-out all`. Every launcher since 2026-08-25 answers it by denylisting every recorded
 *      device at once; one built with this change also swaps its in-memory key.
 *
 * What survives on a launcher older than this change, until its next start: a session minted before
 * per-device ids (2026-08-25), which no denylist can name, and every session if the board had no public
 * origin at the moment of the request (that launcher refuses the request then; there was no remote
 * device to reach it anyway). A launcher that already applied the epoch at its own start leaves this
 * a no-op, because the record is shared.
