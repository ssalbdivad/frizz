// A THREAD'S NAME AND ITS STATUS ARE TWO DIFFERENT THINGS (maintainer 2026-09-29).
//
// The NAME is one or two words: the SUBJECT of the thread — "Shell budgets", "Focus mode", "ArkType
// perf" — never the action taken ("Fix the shell budget default"). In his words: "choose ideal two words
// to differentiate not necessarily based on prompt but best 1 or 2 word summary of intent - the sort of
// subject of the prompt rather than exactly what was done".
//
// A NAME IS THE THREAD'S ID, SO IT IS FINAL THE MOMENT IT EXISTS (maintainer 2026-09-30: "once someone
// sees the id, it cannot change"). The board shows a name as its `@handle`, and the operator types that
// handle into other threads' prompts, so a name that moves strands every mention of it. The first name to
// land stands: a caller's title (a spinoff, `spawn_thread`), else Frizz's mint, else the Codex marker,
// else — only for a thread none of those could name — the worker's own `mcp__frizz__title`. Only a human
// rename changes it after that. Two things used to move it and no longer can: Claude's own session title,
// which showed as the name until the mint landed (and outranked a spinoff's name for good — a thread
// dispatched as "Cache review" read `@pluggable-cache-store-changes-evaluation`), and the worker's
// "correct it once after orienting" rename (`perf-review` became a sentence and then `perf-bench`).
//
// The STATUS is the part that is allowed to move: a short phrase of what is happening NOW, rewritten every
// 5th operator message (periodic-status.ts). It used to be the name itself being rewritten, and that is
// the conflation this module ends.
//
// NAMES ARE NEVER DUPLICATED: "that has to be part of the prompt". No two of a project's non-archived
// threads may share a name once case and punctuation are folded away, and every writer is told the names
// already taken rather than finding out afterwards. The rule is enforced at each writer — the dispatch
// mint and the AI rename (here), the worker's own `mcp__frizz__title` and a human rename (router.ts), and
// the Codex first-output marker (tailer.ts) — because a writer that was merely ASKED to be distinct will
// eventually not be.
