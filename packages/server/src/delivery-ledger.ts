// ── The Claude follow-up delivery ledger ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// Frizz's Claude steer path used to be fire-and-forget: keystrokes went into the worker's own terminal
// and the ONLY record that a follow-up existed was the CLIENT's optimistic gray bubble, reconciled by
// exact text match against whatever later appeared in the JSONL. That made the queued/delivered
// rendering an inference — a mangled injection (the multiline split), a slash command, or a plain
// reload made the message ghost or vanish. This ledger makes the send a server-owned state machine
// instead:
//
//   followUp(deliveryId) ──▶ pending ──(enqueue record matches)──▶ enqueued ──(queued_command /
//   user record matches)──▶ dropped from the ledger — the real transcript record takes over
//   pending ──(no evidence for PENDING_TIMEOUT_MS)──▶ unconfirmed (kept, projected with a warning,
//   dropped after UNCONFIRMED_DROP_MS — after which sending it again is the only recovery)
//
//   …and the state a send OPENS in depends on what the transport's receipt actually proved. `pending`
//   and `enqueued` both mean "not yet read"; `delivered` means the provider took the message straight
//   INTO A TURN — a codex followUp (its receipt names the turn it steered or started) and a Claude
//   follow-up to a thread with no turn in flight (idle daemon, or a cold resume where this message IS
//   what starts the turn). A delivered item renders as an ORDINARY user bubble, never the gray queued
//   one: the agent is already working on it, and graying it is how a message reads as "still enqueued"
//   for the whole seconds-to-minutes window before the provider's own record reaches disk (measured:
//   codex rollout materialization p50 3.3s with tails past an hour; a Claude cold resume ~3s). It still
//   leaves the ledger the same way everything else does — the correlator consumes it when its record
//   lands — and it is deliberately NOT retired by the daemon-death/restart sweeps, which retire only
//   claims about an unread message sitting in a dead process's queue.
//
// The ledger is persisted on the session row (`delivery_ledger`, a small JSON array), correlated by the
// tailer as it folds new JSONL records, and PROJECTED into
// the rendered transcript by readThreadTranscript: a pending/enqueued item renders as the gray queued
// bubble (sourceId `delivery:<id>`) so the queued affordance is server truth — reload-safe, and consumed
// by the client's optimistic bubble via deliveryId rather than text.
//
// An enqueue record is positive evidence Claude Code holds the message in its own queue, and a mid-turn
// queue legitimately lasts as long as the turn does — so `enqueued` outlives the pending timeout. It is
// not IMMORTAL, though, and both of its escape hatches exist because a missed correlation left one
// pinned to a row it no longer described: a LATER USER TURN drops it on the spot (the queue is FIFO, so
// the transcript has moved past it), and failing that it ages out with the unconfirmed items. See
// ageDeliveries.

// Tombstones are capped SEPARATELY from live sends, and the reason is that they are not competing for
// the same thing. A live item is a send in flight and ages out on its own; a tombstone is suppressing
// a JSONL record that will still be there tomorrow, so evicting one resurrects a message the agent
// never read. Sharing one cap meant twenty ordinary follow-ups silently un-retracted an earlier
// cancellation — reachable in an afternoon on a busy thread, not a remote edge. They still need a
// bound (the row holds each message's text), so they get their own, and the oldest goes first.

// `cancelled` is not a delivery state at all — it is a TOMBSTONE, and the only one that outlives its
// own message. The other three describe a send making its way to the agent; this one records a send the
// operator took BACK out of the provider's queue (see cancelDelivery), and it exists purely to keep the
// transcript honest afterwards.
//
// It has to exist because the JSONL never forgets. Claude Code writes a `queue-operation enqueue`
// record the moment it accepts a follow-up, and transcript.ts renders that record as the gray queued
// bubble. Cancelling removes the message from the CLI's queue but cannot unwrite that record.
//
// Nor does the CLI leave anything frizz could attribute the cancellation TO. Measured live
// (_live_sdk_cancel_queued.mts): the cancelled send got its `enqueue` and then nothing that names it —
// no content-bearing `remove`, no `queued_command` attachment, no user record. (A contentless
// `dequeue` was written around the same instant; contentless ops carry no send identity and both the
// parser and the correlator ignore them, so nothing here rests on what produced it.)
//
// Left alone the enqueue bubble therefore outlives the cancellation, and the FIFO backstop in transcript.ts eventually
// UN-GRAYS it when a later message delivers — rendering a message the agent provably never read as a
// message the human sent it. So frizz has to remember the cancellation itself.

//
// The steer channel REWROTE frizz's bytes before they reached the JSONL, so the text frizz sent and the
// text the transcript recorded were not equal and an exact compare stranded the send as `unconfirmed`
// forever. That channel was a COMPOSITION of two rewriters frizz did not own — the paste transport
// (LF→CR) and Claude Code's TUI paste handler (`/\r\n|\r/`→`\n`, `\t`→four spaces) — and measuring it
// against a live claude 2.1.219 TUI, driven through frizz's own paste sequence, showed:
//
//     sent          recorded          note
//     \t            "    "            four spaces, not a tab stop
//     \r\n          \n\n              the line break DOUBLES (CR→LF then LF→newline)
//     \r            \n
//     trailing " ", unicode, nbsp, long unwrapped lines — preserved verbatim
//
// Two distinct classes, not one. The maintainer hit the tab class (2026-07-25,
// `were-taking-over-from-another-agent`: a 1448-char send with two tabs recorded as 1454 chars with
// none, 34ms after the send, and still marked unconfirmed at the 60s timeout). The CRLF class was worse
// and just as reachable — anything pasted from a Windows-authored source or many web textareas — and a
// comparison that preserved line COUNT still stranded it.
//
// So do not model the channel; be INVARIANT to it. Every whitespace run — spaces, tabs, newlines alike
// — collapses to a single space, which was stable under every rewrite above and is stable under any
// future re-flow in the same family (a re-wrap, a trailing-space trim, a different tab width). A broker
// send reaches the JSONL unrewritten, so those two classes cannot recur — but the separator a COALESCED
// record inserts between two glued sends is exactly this kind of difference, so the canonical form is
// still what lets composition line up. What actually keeps it safe is unchanged and lives elsewhere:
// evidence must be CONTEMPORANEOUS, a mid-record match must clear COMPOSED_ANCHOR_MIN, and composition
// consumes items in order. Precedent: the far more dangerous decision this system ever made — whether
// to press Enter on a live composer — was gated on FULL whitespace removal (`squash`, in the since
// deleted delivery-confirm.ts). Applied to BOTH sides of every comparison, so the composition offsets
// in matchComposedText stay internally consistent.
//
// What this deliberately does NOT forgive: differing WORDS. A send whose recorded text differs beyond
// whitespace still ages to `unconfirmed`, which is the warning doing its job.
