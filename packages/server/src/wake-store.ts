// ---- THE QUIET WINDOW ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// EVERY WAKE IS A NEW TURN, and a turn is the expensive unit. A wake lands as a fresh user message in a
// Claude Code session whose context runs 150k–450k tokens; the turn re-reads all of it on every API call
// and typically makes 10–40 calls, so one wake costs $2–3 at list price before the worker has done
// anything useful. Measured on the maintainer's board 2026-09-03: wake-triggered turns were 32% of the
// day's spend (pull-request watchers 20%, the worker's own shell/watch wakes 6%, usage-limit resumes
// 6%), and the outbox showed the shape of the waste — one thread woken SIX times in 40 minutes by one
// PR's review comments (13:08, 13:16, 13:25, 13:39, 13:44, …), each a turn; two threads watching the
// same PR each woken on all eight of an hour's pushes; the limit resume restarting five threads within
// twelve seconds.
//
// So a wake enqueued for a thread that was handed a wake less than this long ago is not claimable until
// the window has elapsed: `next_attempt_at` is pushed out to `lastHandoff + window`, and everything that
// arrives for the thread in the meantime waits beside it and is MERGED into the same delivery when the
// window opens (scheduler.deliverDue). A burst then costs one turn instead of one per event. The
// window is measured from the last HANDOFF — sent or delivered, whichever the store recorded — because
// that is the instant the thread's turn began, and the turn is what is being rationed.
//
// Five minutes is the tradeoff between a worker hearing news promptly and a worker paying a turn per
// event: a PR watcher's poll is already 60s, so news arrives at most four polls late, and a review
// burst (the six-in-40-minutes case above) collapses into one or two turns instead of six.

/** Hint-key prefixes the quiet window does NOT hold. An answer from the human (`answers:`) is the one
 *  delivery a worker is actually waiting on, and the human is sitting right there; a usage-limit
 *  resume (`limit:`) is the thread coming back from a wall it did not choose, and holding it would
 *  only lengthen the outage. A limit resume still merges with anything already pending for the thread;
 *  an answer merges only with other answers (scheduler adoptCompanions).
 *
 *  A background-shell BUDGET WARNING (`shell-budget:`, scheduler SOURCE 13) is a deadline notice: it
 *  tells the worker a kill is coming and asks for an answer. Held, it arrived a whole window late —
 *  observed 2026-09-29, two shells due 8s apart delivered ~5m apart, because the first warning's
 *  handoff opened the window that held the second. The kill clock now runs from delivery, so holding
 *  it no longer shortens the worker's grace, but it still delays the decision and keeps the shell
 *  running a window longer for nothing. And the hold buys no turn: the warning is deliverable
 *  MID-TURN, so a second one due seconds after the first lands inside the turn the first one opened.
 *
 *  A message from ANOTHER THREAD (`thread-message:`) is the same case as an answer: its sender is often
 *  waiting on the reply, and holding it five minutes would make two threads talking cost ten per round.
 *
 *  THE SIGN-OFF NUDGE AND THE FENCE CORRECTIONS answer the worker's OWN rest, and that rest is the card
 *  the human is reading in the queue right now: a bare rest nobody can triage, or a park frizz refused.
 *  Holding the fix for five minutes leaves that card on the board for five minutes, which is the whole
 *  failure the nudge exists to prevent — observed 2026-09-25, a Codex thread's bare rest landing 9s after
 *  its PR-merged wake, its nudge queued 2s later and held until 4m51s after that, by which point the
 *  maintainer had opened it and asked how it stopped without a sign-off. Neither can burst, which is what
 *  the window rations: both are capped per consecutive rest (scheduler SIGNOFF_NUDGE_MAX, PARK_BUMP_MAX).
 *  An EXPIRED park stays held — it is a scheduled re-check, uncapped, and a `for: 30s` re-park would
 *  otherwise wake every 30 seconds. */
