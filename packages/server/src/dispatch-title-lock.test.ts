// TITLE PROVENANCE ACROSS EVERY TRANSPORT.
//
// A title a dispatch CALLER hard-coded — `Investigate acme/app#391` from the GitHub batch, a parent
// agent's guess through spawn_thread — is a real name (title_auto 0, so the UI shows it verbatim
// instead of "Spinning up…") that no human authored (title_locked 0, so the worker's own aiTitle
// supersedes it). Both halves matter and they live on DIFFERENT columns, which is exactly how the
// Claude broker path lost one: it was added a day before the flags were split, so the split patched
// the spawned-CLI and codex writers and left the broker's registry row without `title_locked` at all.
// An absent value is not a type error and normalises to LOCKED (sessionTitleLocked fails safe), so
// every GitHub-dispatched thread froze on `Investigate owner/repo#N` while the far better title the
// worker had already reported sat unread in its transcript.
//
// So this asserts the invariant TRANSPORT BY TRANSPORT rather than through whichever one happens to
// be the default — a fourth transport has to answer the same question before it can ship.
