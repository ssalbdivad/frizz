// REMOVING IDLE WORKTREES (Settings → Remove idle worktrees after, `removeIdleWorktreesDays`, 7 by
// default, 0 = never). Frizz creates no worktree, mandates no folder for one and removes none on done
// (ARCHITECTURE.md § No worktree opinions). But agents that follow the common convention leave
// `<main checkout>/.frizz/worktrees/<slug>` behind once their branch is merged, and nothing ever comes
// back for them. So once shortly after boot and daily after, every registered project's repository is
// looked at, and a worktree in that ONE folder goes when nothing in it could be lost and nobody is in
// it. It replaced (2026-10-07) a fork feature that removed the worktrees a thread's transcript named
// when the thread was marked done; this one keys on the folder and on idleness instead, so it needs no
// hook, no worker-contract text and no coupling to Done.
//
// A worktree is removed only when EVERY check below holds. The first that fails, or that cannot be
// answered (git errors, a file that will not stat), keeps it, and the reason is logged:
//
//   1. It is a LINKED worktree git knows (`git worktree list --porcelain`), inside `.frizz/worktrees`
//      of its repository's main checkout. Not locked (`git worktree remove` would refuse one anyway),
//      not already prunable.
//   2. NO REGISTERED PROJECT IS IN IT. A worktree opened as a Frizz project has its own board and
//      threads, which another tenant's view of "in use" does not cover.
//   3. NO OPEN THREAD IS WORKING IN IT. Any thread on this server that is Running, in the Queue, Pinned
//      or Snoozed — every thread but an unpinned, resting Done one — whose working folder (the tailer's
//      checkout reading, its background shells' folders, its recent sub-agents' folders) is the
//      worktree or inside it. Read from EVERY open project, since a thread may work in another
//      project's worktree; and a repository with a registered project this server has not opened (one
//      served by another Frizz) is skipped whole, because that server's threads are invisible here.
//   4. GIT SAYS IT IS CLEAN: no modified, staged or untracked file (`git status --porcelain`).
//   5. EVERY IGNORED FILE IS REGENERABLE. `git worktree remove` without --force refuses modified and
//      untracked files but deletes IGNORED ones silently, and a `.env`, a local database or a hand-made
//      fixture is ignored precisely because it is not in git. An ignored entry may go only when it is,
//      or lies under, a dependency or build folder named in REGENERABLE_DIRS, or is a file named in
//      REGENERABLE_FILES, or is a `.frizz/` folder holding only Frizz's own `.id` / `.gitignore`
//      markers. A NAME list, not a size or age heuristic: what makes a file safe to delete is that a
//      command rebuilds it, and the name is the only evidence of that git gives. A build output this
//      list does not know keeps its worktree, which is the cheap direction to be wrong in.
//   6. ITS HEAD IS ON A REF. Removing a DETACHED worktree whose commit no branch or tag contains would
//      leave that commit dangling until the next gc. A worktree on a branch passes trivially: branches
//      are never deleted here.
//   7. IDLE FOR AT LEAST N DAYS: now minus the newer of its HEAD's commit time and the newest mtime of
//      any tracked or untracked, non-ignored file. Not the folder's own mtime, which any `ls` of a
//      parent or a build writing an ignored folder moves.
//
// Then `git worktree remove` (never --force: git re-checks clean on its own) and, if anything went,
// `git worktree prune`. Branches are never touched.
