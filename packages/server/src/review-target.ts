// WHAT "REVIEW CHANGES" SHOWS FOR A THREAD — the checkouts its edits are in, for the editor extension to
// diff (packages/vscode review.ts asks git for the rest). Design: ARCHITECTURE.md § VS Code
// extension.
//
// Frizz records nothing about a thread's base: it stays out of the worktree decision (thread-cwd.ts), and
// a thread's start is a transcript, not a commit. What it DOES know is where the thread wrote — the rail's
// edited files, read off the whole transcript and filtered to what git carries (edited-files.ts,
// repo-files.ts) — and where its agent is working now. Those name the checkouts; git names the base:
//
//   - A WORKTREE of the project's repository (thread-cwd.ts liftRepoWorktree) is the thread's own — the
//     way an agent isolates itself — so the review is the whole branch: everything that changed there
//     since it left the branch it came from, committed or not ("branch").
//   - THE PROJECT FOLDER is shared. On this machine several agents and the human edit one working tree at
//     once, so "everything uncommitted" would be mostly other people's work. The review is the thread's
//     own files and nothing else, against the last commit ("files").
//   - A file in no checkout of the project (another repository, a scratch folder outside it) has nothing
//     to diff against that this project can name, and is left out.
//
// The checkout written last comes first — the one the editor window is chosen by — and the folder the
// agent is working in is included even with no edit seen there: a worktree whose changes came from a
// shell (`sed -i`, a codemod, `git apply`) is still the thread's work, and the branch review finds it.
