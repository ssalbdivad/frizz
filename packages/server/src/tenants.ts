// ONE PROCESS, N PROJECTS.
//
// `startServer` used to build exactly one AppContext and tear it down at process exit. That is the
// assumption plans/singleton-frizz.md §4 item 2 calls out: there was no way to open a second project,
// and no way to close one without closing the server.
//
// This is the keyed map that replaces it — projectId → AppContext, with activate/deactivate. The
// AppContext itself needed no changes to get here: it is already a per-call object, documented as
// "derived once at boot and threaded through", with zero `process.chdir`, zero `process.env`
// mutation, and every module-level cache keyed by absolute path or genuinely machine-global.
//
// THE ERROR BOUNDARY LIVES HERE (§4 item 3). Per-subsystem guards are already good — tailer ticks,
// board rebuilds, `fs.watch` setup and transcript discovery are each individually caught. What was
// missing is a catch at the AppContext SEAM, so one project's malformed `.frizz/` (or, until the
// unified database of 2026-08-27, its own corrupt `ui.db`) cannot take down every other project in a
// shared process. `activate` therefore reports and returns
// undefined rather than throwing: a project that will not open is one dead card, not an outage.
