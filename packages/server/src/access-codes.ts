 * it only rotated on the restart that is least convenient to perform. Separating the two fixes that:
 *
 *   CODE     single-use, short-lived, authorizes exactly ONE exchange. Safe to show on a screen.
 *   SESSION  what the code mints. Lasts 30 days, signed, and independently revocable.
 *
 * A leaked code is worthless the moment it is used (or five minutes pass), and a leaked session can be
 * revoked without disturbing anything else. GitHub minting the session instead of a code is policy on
 * top of that split; per-device names and sign-out are built here.
 *
 * REVOCATION IS A DENYLIST, not a session table. A session still verifies from its own signature with
 * no lookup — that is what makes it cheap and restart-proof — and the directory holds only the ids an
 * operator has actually signed out, plus a label per device so the list means something. A board with
 * nothing revoked pays nothing.
