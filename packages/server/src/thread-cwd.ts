// WHERE A THREAD IS WORKING NOW — the folder a terminal opened on it starts in (thread-terminals.ts).
//
// Frizz records only where a thread was LAUNCHED (project.ts workDirOf), and that stops being the answer
// the moment an agent moves: Frizz deliberately stays out of the worktree decision, so an agent that
// wants isolation makes its own worktree (`git worktree add .frizz/worktrees/x`, Claude Code's
// EnterWorktree) and works there. A terminal that opened in the project root then ran `npm test` against
// the wrong checkout — Colin's objection to the standalone Terminal tab upstream. So the terminal asks
// the agent's OWN latest reading of where it is:
//
//   CLAUDE — every transcript record carries the session's `cwd`, and it moves. Checked against real
//     transcripts on 2026-09-29 (~/.claude/projects): a Bash `cd` into a folder inside the project
//     moves it and keeps it moved (e.g. `cd .frizz/worktrees/pre-queue-check` → every later record's
//     `cwd` is that worktree); a `cd` OUTSIDE the project does not stick, because Claude Code resets the
//     shell to the project and says so; and EnterWorktree moves it for the rest of the session (a live
//     `claude -p` run: `cwd` went from the repo to `<repo>/.claude/worktrees/probe` on the first record
//     after the tool call, and the transcript was re-bucketed under the worktree's log dir). Not every
//     record has one — a trailing `cost-state` record does not — so the newest record that DOES wins.
//   CODEX — a rollout's tool calls carry the `workdir` each command ran in (transcript.ts reads it for
//     the tool card), so the newest one is where the agent last worked; before any tool call, the
//     session's own recorded folder (`codex_app_server_session.cwd`).
//   ANYTHING ELSE, or no reading at all — the project root.
//
// A reading is then lifted to the CHECKOUT it lies in: the agent's cwd is often a subfolder it `cd`ed
// into for one grep (`packages/web/src`), and the terminal belongs in the checkout — the project root, or
// the worktree — not in whatever folder the last command happened to need. The walk stops at the project
// root, so a project that is itself a folder inside a larger repository is never climbed out of. The
// human sees the result in the terminal dialog and can edit it before anything starts.

// WHERE A SHELL STARTS when its command opens with a `cd`. The launch record's `cwd` is where the SESSION
// was; `cd /home/ssalb/frizz/packages/web && nubx vite` runs the server somewhere else, and a worktree
// shell is very often exactly `cd .frizz/worktrees/x && …`. Deliberately NARROW: one leading `cd` to a
// literal path, then `&&` or `;`. A bare token with no `$`, backtick, glob or subshell character, or the
// same wrapped in plain quotes; `~` is the home folder and a relative path resolves against `base`.
// Anything cleverer (`cd "$D"`, `pushd`, a `cd` mid-command, a subshell) answers undefined and the shell
// keeps the session's folder until the OS names the one its process is really in (shell-cwd-probe.ts).
