// ── KEEP A PLUGGED-IN MACHINE AWAKE WHILE REMOTE ACCESS IS ON ────────────────────────────────────────
//
// wake-lock.ts holds the machine awake only while an agent is working. That left remote access dark on
// every quiet night (2026-10-07): the last turn ended at 23:11, the control plane logged "nothing running;
// the machine may sleep", Windows idle-slept at 00:47 on its one-hour AC timeout, and
// ssalbdivad.frizz.sh reported the board as not running until a keypress woke the laptop at 09:27. A
// board that is reachable from a phone is only useful if the machine behind it is up.
//
// So while a public origin is declared — a relay name, a tunnel, any remote setup — the SUPERVISOR holds
// the same "system required" request, but only while the machine is on AC power: on battery it may
// sleep as before, because draining a laptop overnight to keep a URL answering is not a trade the
// maintainer chose (2026-10-07, "Only while plugged in"). Unknown power state counts as battery, for the
// same reason. The supervisor rather than the control plane, because it is the process that owns the
// public origin and it outlives every control-plane restart, so the hold has no restart gap to bridge.
