/**
 * Render a string as a QR code a phone can read off a terminal — any terminal, any font, any theme.
 *
 * Three decisions, each the difference between "scans" and "does not scan" for some real set of people.
 * The measurements behind them (xterm.js in headless Chrome across its renderers, nine fonts, line
 * heights 1.0–1.5, three themes, each shot decoded by zxing-cpp and Apple Vision after a simulated
 * camera) are summarised in the commit that introduced this comment.
 *
 * TWO STYLES, AND THE GLYPH IS THE RISK. A terminal cell is about twice as tall as it is wide, so a
 * square module is either half a cell (`half`: two module rows per cell, split by `▀`/`▄`; 41x21 cells
 * for a typical sign-in link) or two whole cells side by side (`paint`: background colour only, no glyph
 * at all; 82x41, four times the area). One cell per module is a code stretched 2:1, which Apple Vision
 * refused in about two thirds of the configurations measured even when every pixel was right.
 *
 * `half` is exact wherever the terminal draws block elements ITSELF — iTerm2, kitty, WezTerm, Alacritty,
 * Ghostty, Warp, Windows Terminal, VTE, and VS Code's default WebGL renderer: 100% at every line height
 * and letter spacing measured. Where the terminal draws `▀` from the FONT (macOS Terminal.app, VS Code's
 * DOM fallback, conhost) the glyph rarely fills the cell: SF Mono's and Menlo's half blocks stop 14–16%
 * short of the top of the line box, Monaco has none at all, and any extra line height or letter spacing
 * opens a gap the font knows nothing about. The previous rendering (always dark ink, so `▀` over a dark
 * top module) let that gap show the light field through every dark run and striped the finder patterns:
 * with Menlo, SF Mono or Monaco at line height 1.0 it decoded in 0% of the font-drawn configurations.
 * `paint` has no glyph to misplace and decoded in all of them. So: `half` where the terminal is known to
 * draw block elements itself, `paint` where it is not and the caller says there is room, and `half` as
 * the fallback when there is not.
 *
 * A HALF BLOCK'S SHORTFALL MUST SHOW THE RIGHT COLOUR. In a mixed cell the glyph draws one module and
 * the cell's background is the other, so wherever a font-drawn glyph falls short the background shows.
 * `▄` (ink = bottom module, background = top module) falls short at the TOP edge — every font measured
 * reaches the bottom of its line box — where the background IS the top module's colour, so the miss is
 * invisible. Extra line height also opens a strip at the bottom edge, where the top colour is wrong; that
 * strip only shows when the module below continues the bottom module's colour, and in that case `▀` over
 * the bottom module (whose own miss is at the top) is used instead, unless the module above continues
 * the top colour and it would stripe too. That rule took font-drawn line heights 1.0–1.2 from 6–61% to
 * 100%; a uniform cell stays a bare space over its colour, with no glyph at all.
 *
 * COLOURS FROM THE 256 CUBE, NEVER THE 16 THEMEABLE ONES. Indices 0–15 belong to the user's theme: every
 * base16 light scheme makes colour 0 its LIGHT background and 15 its DARK text, which turned the previous
 * `38;5;0`/`48;5;15` into an inverted code no decoder read, and VS Code's Light+ greys 15 to `#a5a5a5`.
 * `232` (#080808) and `231` (#ffffff) are fixed in every 256-colour terminal; `16` is avoided because
 * base16-shell rewrites 16–21. The quiet zone is drawn, not assumed — a code flush against surrounding
 * text is unreadable even when the code itself is perfect.
