 * `label` is DISPLAY, so it is host-agnostic: a GitLab or Gitea origin gets its "owner/repo" shown
 * just the same, and falls back to the directory name when there is no remote at all. `githubRepo` is
 * a LINK TARGET — what the rendered-markdown autolinker turns `#123` and a bare commit hash into — so
 * it goes through the host-strict parser whose spoof cases (`github.com.evil.com`) are unit-tested in
 * github.test.ts. Rendering a GitLab project's `#12` as a github.com URL is a WRONG destination, which
 * is worse than no link at all; absent here simply means the augmentation stays off.
 *
 * No `gh`, no network: this is the local git remote, so autolinking works signed out and with gh
 * absent entirely (the picker's `githubStatus` gate is a different, gh-authoritative question).
