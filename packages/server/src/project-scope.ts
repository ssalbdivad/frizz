// ONE DATABASE, EVERY PROJECT — the seam that keeps a project's rows its own (2026-08-27).
//
// Frizz kept one SQLite file per project until this landed: `~/.frizz/projects/<id>/ui.db`, fifty-four
// of them on the maintainer's machine, each carrying its own copy of every table and its own unversioned
// migration state. A bad migration (the retired thread_watch table coming back with a new shape) left
// seven of them unopenable at once and the launch project among them, which aborted a restart; the
// maintainer's verdict was that the per-project file was a vestige of the one-server-per-repo era and
// should go. So every table now carries `project_id`, one file holds every project, and this module is
// how a tenant addresses only its own rows without every call site learning that.
//
// A ProjectScope wraps the SHARED connection for ONE project. Its `prepare` REFUSES a statement that
// does not name `@project_id` — at prepare time, so a forgotten scope fails the first test that builds
// the storage rather than silently reading another project's thread — and the Statement it returns
// binds the project id itself: merged into a named bag, or supplied as a bag ahead of positional values
// (sqlite.ts binds both). Call sites keep their existing arguments.
//
// WHAT THE ASSERTION CANNOT SEE: a subquery. `WHERE slug = @slug AND NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM session
// WHERE slug = @slug)` names @project_id nowhere and would be refused; the same statement with the
// outer WHERE scoped and the inner one not would pass, and the inner one would then see every project.
// storage.test.ts's cross-project isolation case is the net for that — every method is run against one
// project with an identical twin in another, and the twin's rows are compared before and after.
//
// `writes` counts the `run()` calls through this scope that CHANGED a row. It is what storage.ts's
// memoised whole-table read invalidates on instead of `total_changes()`: the connection is shared, so
// that counter moves for every project's writes and would re-read this project's rows whenever ANY
// project wrote. A write to this project's rows can only come through this scope (or through a raw
// `db.exec`, which the boot repairs are — and they run before any cache exists), so the count is exact
// for the one connection.
//
// `writes(table)` narrows it to the statements that write THAT table, because the session cache was
// being thrown away by writes that could not have touched a session row. Measured 2026-10-01 on a
// mirror of the maintainer's machine (9 projects, 440 sessions, 6 threads streaming): the board
// re-read and re-materialised every session row on nearly every assemble — `readAllSessions` 932ms
// and `plainRow` 879ms of a 40s profile — because (a) the per-assemble snooze sweep is an UPDATE that
// usually matches nothing, and `writes++` counted it anyway (`total_changes()`, which this replaced,
// did not), and (b) the tailer's `tail_state` flush, every tick a transcript grows, bumped the same
// counter. So a run that changed nothing no longer counts, and a statement's target table is read off
// its SQL at prepare time. The classification is CONSERVATIVE: only a plain `INSERT INTO t` /
// `REPLACE INTO t` / `UPDATE t` / `DELETE FROM t` is attributed to `t`; anything else that writes (a
// `WITH … UPDATE`, a statement this parser does not recognise) counts against EVERY table, so a new
// statement can over-invalidate but never serve stale rows. Triggers are not followed: the schema's
// only trigger (`session_former_titles`) writes the table that fired it, so attributing the outer
// statement is already exact — re-check that if a trigger that crosses tables is ever added.
