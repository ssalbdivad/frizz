// Unowned broker daemons — the ones a booting Frizz finds running under a project's state dir and does
// NOT adopt.
//
// A broker daemon is forked detached into its own process group, so it outlives the server on purpose:
// a restart rejoins it (`warmUp` binds every daemon whose session is an open broker row) and a running
// turn never notices. The cost of that design is that a daemon NO row claims is rejoined by nobody. The
// hibernation sweep skips it (it has no row to reason about), the orphan reaper never touches a session
// root, and the daemon's own six-hour idle timer is the only thing left to end it.
//
// Found on the maintainer's machine 2026-10-08: the supervisor force-stopped a wedged server one minute
// after it forked a dispatch's daemon. Dispatch writes the thread's row only once `spawnDispatch`
// resolves, so the row never landed; the human re-sent the prompt, which minted a new session under the
// SAME slug, and the first daemon sat there with its `claude` (~155 MB) and frizz MCP server (~50 MB),
// unattached and unreferenced, with no transcript — it never received its prompt. Nothing logged it.
//
// So every boot now LISTS each unowned daemon in the server log — session id, pid, why no row claims it,
// age and last activity — and the same pass repeats on the hibernation sweep's cadence, logging only a
// daemon it has not listed before or whose verdict changed. It ENDS exactly one class: a daemon no row
// references AT ALL and that has never written a transcript. That one provably holds no conversation
// (Claude Code writes the transcript with the first message), no thread can ever reach it (no row means
// no board surface, no follow-up, no approval card), and so ending it loses nothing. Every other class
// is listed and left alone, because each can be a turn still running:
//   - `archived`: a thread archived while its worker ran keeps that worker until it rests (the Running
//     band documents it), and a daemon in the middle of a turn is never interrupted.
//   - `not-adopted`: a row names the session but is not an open broker row under that id (another
//     runtime, or the id is only its transcript's); a confused reading is not a licence to kill.
//   - `no-row` WITH a transcript: a hard-deleted or replaced thread's daemon. It may be mid-tool-call,
//     editing files; its own idle timer collects it once it stops.
// The pass is periodic, not boot-only, because of the age guard: a supervisor restarts a dead server in
// seconds, so the daemon that motivated this was 74s old when the next boot looked at it. It fails
// CLOSED like the hibernator and the orphan reaper: an enumeration that throws ends nothing, a transcript
// probe that cannot answer counts as a transcript, and a daemon under ten minutes old is left for
// whatever dispatch may still be about to write its row (the row lands once the daemon has taken the
// prompt, and a prompt it took is a transcript on disk within seconds).
