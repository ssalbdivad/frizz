// THE WORKING STATUS: while a thread's turn runs, keep its status line naming the TASK it is on, and
// change it only when the work fundamentally moves (maintainer 2026-09-29: "have each thread always
// display a brief status message of what it's working on when it's working and how long it has been
// working on that specific task — it should update status every time it fundamentally shifts what it
// is doing"). The elapsed half is `session.status_at`, which storage stamps only when the TEXT changes,
// so a check that keeps the task keeps its clock.
//
// periodic-status.ts owns the status at REST (every 5th operator message, Sonnet). This owns it while the
// turn runs, and hands back at the rest: `onTurnDone` reports whether the turn wore a working status, and
// the caller then forces one rest write so a rested card does not go on saying "Running the tests".
//
// COST, which is what the maintainer asked about first. One Sonnet one-shot per running thread at most
// every INTERVAL, and only when its transcript has actually moved (the tailer calls `onActivity` on a
// tick that folded new bytes of an in-flight turn) — a thread blocked in one long command costs nothing.
// Sonnet, not Haiku, and measured (2026-09-29, 22 checkpoints over two real worker transcripts): Haiku
// answered SAME 4 times in 22 and reworded a still-true status at almost every other check, which resets
// the clock the status exists to carry; it also narrated ("The agent has…") about one check in ten.
// Sonnet held the task through screenshot and typecheck steps and moved exactly when the developer's
// follow-up or a landing did. FRIZZ_LIVE_STATUS_MODEL overrides it.
// The model is asked a yes/no-shaped question ("still on this task? reply SAME") over a bounded window,
// so a check is a few thousand input tokens and a handful out. The first check waits FIRST_MS into the
// turn, so a quick answer that rests in seconds never pays for one. The one-shot spawns a throwaway CLI
// session per call, so the context wires this to its OWN completer: a dispatch's name mint must not queue
// behind a fleet's status checks.
