// THE BACKGROUND-SHELL RUNTIME BUDGET — a shell ends on a clock only when somebody DECLARED one.
//
// History, because the rule has already moved once. Colin built background shells with NO clock, on
// purpose (tailer.bgShellViews: "NO clock is a correct clock"): frizz cannot tell a CI watcher from a
// dev server from outside, and some shells legitimately run for days. On 2026-09-29 the maintainer
// found a shell 16 hours old ("background shells running for 16 hours makes no sense") and 4e5eaca1
// gave EVERY shell a budget — its Bash `timeout`, else a 1h default. Within the day the default killed a
// real arktype shell at 17h that its worker had registered under a 20h `watch`: the clock was
// universal, and a universal clock is exactly the rule Colin had rejected.
//
// So the budget is OPT-IN (maintainer 2026-09-29), and the question is asked of the one party that CAN
// tell a poller from a server — the worker, at the moment it launches the shell:
//
//  · AT SPAWN. A Claude worker sizes a shell with the Bash tool's own `timeout` on its
//    `run_in_background` call — the knob it already has, already in ms, already capped at 24h by
//    BASH_MAX_TIMEOUT_MS (backend/types.ts). NO `timeout` ⇒ NO budget: the shell runs until it ends or
//    is stopped. The worker is prompted to choose, not forced: the contract says so, and the
//    PreToolUse hook (cc-worker/hooks/bash-background.mjs) adds one line of context to a background
//    call that carries no `timeout` — a poller, build or check gets one; a server or watcher does not.
//  · IN THE MOMENT. `mcp__frizz__extend_shell` sets or moves a budget on ANY running shell, including
//    one launched without — which is also the only way a codex background exec (no launch-time knob)
//    ever gets one.
//  · ENFORCED only once declared: past the deadline the worker gets ONE wake (scheduler SOURCE 13),
//    mid-turn if busy — keep it (`extend_shell`) or stop it — and silence for SHELL_BUDGET_GRACE_MS
//    after that wake REACHES the worker ends it through the operator's own × path.
//
// WHAT KEEPS AN UNBUDGETED SHELL HONEST is visibility, not a clock: every running shell is on the
// thread's drawer strip and its queue card, with its age and a Stop control (web QueueChildOps /
// BackgroundOpsStrip), and a worker coming to rest behind a question is nudged about strays.
//
// A `watch` on the shell MOVES its deadline to the watch's own expiry — see resolveShellBudget.
//
// The numbers:
//  · GRACE 10m after the warning is DELIVERED — not after the deadline, and not after it was queued: a
//    server that was down across the deadline, or a wake that sat in the outbox, must still leave the
//    worker its full ten minutes to answer before anything is killed (scheduler shellBudgetGraceFrom).
//  · MAX 24h per declaration — the same ceiling as BASH_MAX_TIMEOUT_MS and a `watch`'s `for:`
//    (AWAITING_FOR_MAX_MS). A shell that must outlive a day is re-declared, one day at a time — or
//    launched without a budget at all.
//
// A `Monitor` carries NO budget and cannot be given one: a persistent one is itself a declaration that
// it runs for the session, and a non-persistent one ends at its own `timeout_ms` (Claude caps it at 1h).

 *
 *  The BASE is an `extend_shell` deadline recorded for THIS shell, else launch + its declared budget,
 *  else nothing at all — there is no default.
 *
 *  AN ARMED WATCH EXTENDS, it does not exempt. The worker that registers `watch {shell, for: 20h}` has
 *  declared, in the one place it declares a wait's length, that it expects the shell to be worth
 *  waiting on for 20h; killing it at 17h (the arktype shell, 2026-09-29) betrays that declaration. So
 *  the deadline becomes max(base, the watch's expiry). Extending rather than exempting because:
 *   · every reader then sees the TRUE end — the `activity` readout, the card's "2h left" — where an
 *     exemption would report a deadline long past while nothing happened at it;
 *   · it is still bounded: a watch expires (≤24h) and wakes its worker (evalOwnWatches), and if the
 *     shell is still running past a budget it DECLARED, the ordinary warning follows at that instant;
 *   · `unwatch` hands the shell straight back to the budget it had, with no special case;
 *   · arming a watch after a warning moves the deadline, which re-arms the warning and cancels the
 *     pending kill exactly as `extend_shell` does — the same mechanism, not a second one.
 *  A watch never CREATES a budget on an unbudgeted shell: the watch's `for:` is how long the WAIT is
 *  registered, not how long the process may live. */
