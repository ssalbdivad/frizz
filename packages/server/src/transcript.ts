// fold). Three harness paths deliver text that is no longer byte-identical to what was enqueued, so the
// exact-key lookup misses and the gray bubble becomes IMMORTAL — the "stuck enqueued" bug. Each shape
// below reconstructs the enqueued text STRUCTURALLY rather than fuzzy-matching: a plain
// `deliveredText.includes(queuedText)` was measured against all 681 transcripts on this machine and
// produced four false positives (a message that merely MENTIONS "`/reload-plugins`" or "/etc/docker/
// config.json" resolves a genuinely-pending `/reload-plugins` or `/config`), which would silently
// un-gray a message the agent never received.

// SHAPE 1 — the SDK path coalesces the whole queue into ONE user record. Claude Code 2.1.220 with
// `promptSource:"sdk"` emits N content-less `dequeue`s and then a single user record whose content is the
// N queued texts joined by "\n" (verified byte-exact). Neither key matches, so BOTH bubbles stuck AND the
// merged record rendered as a third copy of the same words. Reconstruction is exact and must consume the
// ENTIRE delivered text, walking pending entries in FIFO (Map insertion) order — a partial drain leaves
// the rest pending, which is correct. 2 such deliveries in the corpus, covering 5 queued messages.
//
// The walk may SKIP a pending entry, because not every entry is still in the queue when it drains: an
// UNQUEUED send leaves only a contentless `dequeue` behind (see cancelDelivery — the CLI writes nothing
// content-bearing), so its enqueue bubble is still registered here and sits in the middle of the FIFO
// order. Breaking on it broke the whole reconstruction: the maintainer queued five sends, retracted the
// 3rd and 4th to fix dictation typos, and the delivered record was sends 1+2+5 — the old walk matched
// 1 and 2, hit the retracted 3rd, bailed, and all three delivered bubbles stayed gray while the record
// rendered a fourth copy (2026-08-24, `i-want-to-design-a-framework-2`). Skipping keeps the match exact
// — the ENTIRE text must still be a "\n"-join of a FIFO subsequence — and a skipped entry stays pending,
// where its cancellation tombstone (or the FIFO backstop) accounts for it. Backtracking, not greedy: a
// consumed prefix that strands the remainder must be retried as a skip, or key sets like ["a","a\nb"]

// a shape a future harness version invents is unrecognized by construction — and the FIFO backstop only
// heals a stranded bubble once a LATER delivery is recognized, which never comes for the NEWEST message.
// That is the case a human actually sees, and it is how this bug was reported: the parser already carried
// a fix for Claude Code 2.1.207's SDK shape, and 2.1.220 changed it again.
//
// So the render layer applies the shape-independent rule the fold cannot: a queued bubble this old is
// stale no matter what its delivery looked like. Measured over the 3223 deliveries in this machine's
// corpus, a legitimately-queued message waits p50 0.1s, p99 2.5min, p99.9 5.2min, MAX 54min (one; none
// above an hour) — a mid-turn queue lasts as long as its turn, so the ceiling is generous rather than
// tight. At 2h nothing measured is touched, and an unrecognized shape degrades to "renders as an ordinary
// message" instead of "gray forever". Never a splice: a sent message must not vanish, and the text here
// is the human's own. This is the transcript twin of ageDeliveries' UNCONFIRMED_DROP_MS, which fixed the

 * Both readers used to do one `decoder.write()` over the whole unread range. On a warm cache that is
 * a few KB and fine; on a COLD fold of a large transcript it is the entire file, and Node caps a
 * string at ~512MB — so a 566MB transcript threw ERR_STRING_TOO_LONG and readTranscript's
 * `catch { return [] }` (annotated for the transient "file not written yet" case) turned it into an
 * EMPTY CHAT, silently and permanently.
 *
 * Worse, `bytesRead` was advanced BEFORE the decode, so the throw left the shared cache entry parked
 * at EOF with an empty fold: every later call saw nothing left to read and returned nothing, in 0ms,
 * without touching the file. Measured on the real file — call #1 113ms, calls #2 and #3 0ms, all zero
 * messages, while a 68MB control returned 300.
 *
 * So: advance `bytesRead` only AFTER a window has been ingested. A partial failure then costs the
 * unread tail, not the whole thread. Windowing is safe without any line alignment because both layers
 * already handle their own boundaries — StringDecoder buffers a split UTF-8 sequence, and the fold
 * buffers a trailing partial LINE (see ingest: "preserved exactly across chunk boundaries").
