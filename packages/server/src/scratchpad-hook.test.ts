// ---- scratch-directory hook (cc-worker/hooks/scratchpad.mjs) ----
// Keeps a worker aware of its per-thread scratch DIRECTORY and re-orients it there when the context is
// lost: it names what is in the directory after a compaction/resume, tells the summarizer those files
// exist, and nudges when the context has moved on since the last write. These tests EXECUTE the real
// hook the way Claude Code does — argv flags, a JSON event on stdin, output on stdout — rather than
// asserting on its source, because the whole value of the hook is its wire behavior. Verified live
// against cli 2.1.220 as well: a real session quoted injected text with zero tool calls,
// `PreCompact:manual` logged status 0, and PostToolUse additionalContext reached the model mid-turn.
//
// IT POINTS, IT NO LONGER INJECTS. Until 2026-08-06 frizz provisioned one canonical `scratch.md` and
// this hook spliced its head into the emptied window. The maintainer replaced that with a free-form
// directory plus the recurring prompt's post_compaction trigger, so the guaranteed channel is now
// something the WORKER arms and the OPERATOR can see. What the hook still owes is the listing — and

// A Home worker runs in the operator's home folder, but its board lives in Frizz's state directory:
// `~/.frizz` is Frizz's legacy data root, and creating it switches an install onto it at the next boot.
// Frizz names the board root with FRIZZ_BOARD_ROOT (Claude) or `--board-root` (codex's shared
// app-server, which carries no per-thread env). The cwd below gets its OWN `.frizz/` so that a hook
// ignoring the board root would succeed there — and fail these tests — rather than error out.
