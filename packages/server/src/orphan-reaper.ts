// Orphan process reaper — frizz runs a worker per thread inside a DETACHED DAEMON (a Claude thread in
// its own session broker, a codex thread in the app-server; both forked with `detached: true` into
// their own process group), and each worker spawns auxiliary processes for its task: MCP servers,
// dev/watch servers, and verification browsers (chrome-devtools-mcp, agent-browser, puppeteer).
// Stopping a thread SIGTERMs the daemon's pid, so anything that daemonized out of that process group
// (agent-browser double-forks its Chrome to launchd; a `node --watch` reparents on crash) SURVIVES the
// stop and leaks — permanently, since nothing else collects it. Over days this accretes GBs of orphaned
// Chrome/node whose owning thread is long gone. This module reaps exactly those.
//
// Ownership is read from the env marker every worker carries: FRIZZ_THREAD=<slug> (set at spawn in
// dispatch.ts/resume.ts), inherited by everything the worker spawns. A slug is LIVE iff a live
// `claude`/`codex` session process still carries it — a worker's only OS-level agent process is its
// session root (Agent sub-agents are in-process), so this is exact and socket-agnostic (it protects
// a live adhoc-stack's workers automatically, since their roots are alive on the machine).
//
// It also collects one non-process leak of the same shape, on its own much slower timer: the unix
// SOCKET FILES dead Claude session brokers leave in $TMPDIR (see the stale-socket sweep at the bottom
// of this file). Same story — an artifact of a worker that is gone, which nothing else revisits.
//
// SAFETY — the reaper only ever kills an AUXILIARY process whose slug is live NOWHERE. It never
// touches: a session root (`claude`/`codex`, or anything bearing `--session-id`), a leftover tmux
// server from a pre-cutover frizz (it carries the first thread's slug in env but is shared
// infrastructure — see isTmuxServer), the reaper's own process or any ancestor (so it can never kill
// the server it runs in — which is untagged anyway,
// being user-spawned rather than worker-spawned), or any process whose slug is currently live. Every
// enumeration failure fails CLOSED (reap nothing). An age guard skips just-spawned processes.

 * platforms document for "every process" (macOS ps treats it as `-ax`; verified identical output
 * there 2026-08-24, and procps only tolerates the BSD `-ax` form as a compatibility special case).
 *
 * The slug is then read FROM THE ENVIRONMENT ONLY, per platform. On Linux, `/proc/<pid>/environ` —
 * NUL-delimited, so only an exact `FRIZZ_THREAD=<slug>` entry matches and none of the pass-2 record
 * parsing below applies. procps has no `-E`: on a Linux install the old unconditional pass 2 failed
 * every sweep with `error: unsupported SysV option` into the server log (reported 2026-08-24), so the
 * reaper silently reaped nothing there. On macOS, pass 2 is `ps -Eww` (env appended after argv) with
 * the pass-1 argv prefix stripped off first. Reading the slug from env — never argv — is what stops a literal
 * `FRIZZ_THREAD=x` inside a process's argv (pasted task text, an `env FRIZZ_THREAD=x …` invocation,
 * a grep) from spoofing ownership and mis-attributing a live thread's slug.
 *
 * On macOS, deliberately TWO passes, not one `-Eww` pass storing the whole line: a process's full
 * environment (which `ps -E` appends) contains its secrets — API keys, tokens, private keys. The retained
 * `command` is argv-only, and the env-bearing text never escapes this function beyond the slug regex,
 * so secrets can't leak into a log or error. The cost is a negligible pid-reuse race (a pid reassigned
 * between the two sub-ms `ps` calls fails the `${pid} ${argv}` marker match → no slug → not reaped, so
 * the race is fail-safe, never a false kill).
 *
 * Env VALUES can contain newlines (PEM keys, JSON service accounts), so a pass-2 record spans several
 * physical lines; records are delimited by their `<pid> <argv>` marker and false splits re-merged,
 * rather than split on raw newlines. Returns only same-user, parseable rows. macOS `ps -E` cannot read
 * the env of SIP platform binaries like /bin/sleep, but every process a worker actually leaks — node
 * MCP/dev servers and Chrome browsers — is a non-system binary whose env IS readable (verified in the
 * harness). A total env-pass failure fails closed (every slug null → nothing reapable).
 *
 * A PARTIAL failure, though, does NOT fail closed, and this comment claimed the opposite until
 * 2026-08-19 — "since a root and its aux share one env read there is no partial mode that hides a live
 * root while surfacing its aux." They share the `ps` CALL, not the per-record PARSE, and the parse is
 * per-pid: anything that drops one record while keeping its neighbours' is exactly that partial mode.
 * The pid-column padding bug at (c) below was one, and it hid live ROOTS specifically. So the invariant
 * to hold on to is narrower than it looks — a null slug is safe on an AUX row (never reaped) and
 * dangerous on a ROOT row (its whole thread reads dead), and any future change here has to be judged
 * against the second case, not the first.

  //      record start (a false split inside a multiline value), rather than splitting on raw \n.

// ── Stale broker sockets (files, not processes) ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// A Claude session broker that was SIGKILLed, or whose record a successor had already taken, leaves
// its socket FILE in $TMPDIR forever: the host only ever derives the one path belonging to the session
// it is connecting for, so nothing revisits the rest. Measured on this machine 2026-07-27: ~119 dead
// `frizz-claude-*.sock` against ~4 live. The codex daemon already collects its own family on every
// daemon start; the broker has no equivalent moment, and its litter is the larger pile — so it is
// collected HERE, from the one long-lived process the board always has.
//
// The rules that make this safe — never even CONNECT to a socket some process still references, and
// unlink only on a kernel-refused probe — live in backend/stale-socket-sweep.ts. Nothing here decides
// what is dead.
//
// Deliberately on its OWN, much slower timer rather than inside sweepOrphansOnce(): that function is
// the tested unit and its `ps` call count is asserted, while this pass spawns a machine-wide `lsof -U`
// that has no business running once a minute for a leak measured in a handful of files per hour.

// command line but not the env block, and reading a foreign PEB needs a native call. So an enumerator
// there would attribute nothing: every slug null, nothing reapable, nothing to report. Rather than run
// that theatre once a minute, or swallow `spawn ps ENOENT` once a minute in silence as it did until
// 2026-09-11 (Windows audit, finding 6), the reaper says this and stays off. What it implies is real:
