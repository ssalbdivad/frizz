// The JSONL tailer: incrementally reads each registered session's Claude Code transcript
// (~/.claude/projects/<cwdSlug>/<session_id>.jsonl) to derive liveness telemetry — last activity
// time, a preview of the last assistant text, and whether the current TURN is in flight or idle.
// Per the architecture invariant, this file is TELEMETRY ONLY: it never gates correctness, parses
// defensively (bad line skipped, unknown type ignored, never throws), and degrades to "unknown"
// on any schema surprise rather than crashing.
//
// ---- TURN-STATE HEURISTIC (chosen empirically) ----
// Investigated the 15 real transcripts in ~/.claude/projects/-Users-colinmcd94-Documents-projects-frizz/.
// Record `type`s observed: assistant, user, attachment, queue-operation, last-prompt, ai-title,
// permission-mode, mode, bridge-session, file-history-snapshot, system. Only `assistant`, `user`,
// and `system` carry a `timestamp`; the rest are sidecar metadata (no timestamp).
//
// The DEFINITIVE turn-end signal is `assistant.message.stop_reason`. Across every transcript, an
// assistant message is split into one JSONL record per content block, and ALL records of a given
// message share the same stop_reason:
//   - "tool_use"  → the model is calling tools; the turn CONTINUES (a tool_result user record and
//                   further assistant records will follow).
//   - "end_turn"  → the model has finished; control returns to the prompt (the agent is IDLE).
// Empirically EVERY completed transcript's last substantive record is an assistant `end_turn`
// (optionally trailed by sidecar `system`/`last-prompt`/`ai-title` records). Counts across the
// corpus: 363 tool_use+tool_use, 209 tool_use+thinking, 117 tool_use+text, 41 end_turn.
//
// Derivation over the "last substantive record" (assistant or user; sidecar types ignored):
//   - assistant, stop_reason "end_turn"  → idle (definitive)
//   - assistant, stop_reason "tool_use"  → in-flight (tool exchange ongoing; DO NOT time out —
//                                          Opus tool latency routinely exceeds 5s)
//   - assistant, stop_reason missing/other → BACKSTOP: idle iff no append for >5s, else in-flight
//   - user (a fresh prompt or a tool_result) → in-flight (the model is about to respond)
//   - no substantive records yet             → in-flight (spawning; the worker is live)
// The 5s backstop only fires for an UNKNOWN stop_reason, so it can never override a clear tool_use.

// short ticks instead, and costs nothing steady-state because an already-primed row is cheap.
//
// A row that does not get primed this tick is simply not in `states` yet, which is the same condition

// now the ONLY thing that retired a shell was its `<task-notification>`, and one whose process died
// without emitting one stayed "running" forever: the maintainer's board showed `RUNNING · 2583 MIN` —
// 43 hours — for a process that did not exist.
//
// The correlation key frizz already holds is the OUTPUT PATH. A background shell's stdout and stderr are
// redirected into `<taskId>.output`, so whichever process holds that file open IS the shell. Verified
// against a known-alive control (two holders, fds 1w and 2w, pid visible) and a known-dead one (zero).
// That makes this an exact question with an exact answer, which is what an age threshold could never be —
// and it matters here specifically because frizz's own contract tells workers to wait with
// `until <cond>; do sleep 5; done`, a healthy shell that prints nothing for hours by design.
//
// UNDEFINED means "cannot tell" and is never treated as dead: no probe, no path, or a platform without
// a probe all leave the shell exactly as it was.
//
// WINDOWS has no `lsof`, and until 2026-09-11 the ENOENT from spawning it was the "cannot tell" above —
// every finished shell stayed "running" forever, the exact 43-hour phantom the probe exists to retire
// (Windows audit 2026-09-11, finding 9). The question is the same one — who holds `<taskId>.output`
// open? — asked the way Windows can answer it: open the file with FileShare.None. That succeeds only
// when NO other handle is open on it, and fails with ERROR_SHARING_VIOLATION (32) when any is, so the
// verdict is the OS's own handle table, not a heuristic. It runs through PowerShell because that is
// the only spawnable thing present on every supported Windows (see process-generation.ts for the
// measurements); one process answers the whole batch. A pid probe (`process.kill(pid, 0)`) would be
// cheaper, but nothing records a shell's pid anywhere frizz can read — the launch result carries a
// task id and an output path and nothing else — so there is no pid to ask about.
//
// The failure directions are the same as lsof's. A sharing violation is "held" (alive) — a Frizz
// reader with the file open for the drawer momentarily reads as alive, which costs a TTL, never a
// verdict; any other outcome is "unknown", which is never dead; and only a clean exclusive open of an

// and one call in a CPU sample reached 1.88 s. Every RPC the browser had in flight waited behind it.

// registers as an ask here exactly as it still renders as a card in the web.
// A QUOTED opener never counts: a worker documenting the protocol wraps its sample in an outer ````
// fence, and flagging that as a live ask parks the thread in "awaiting you" over an example. The
// fenced-interior scan is the one piece genuinely SHARED with the web (@frizz/shared) rather than

// ---- DESCENDANTS: a sub-agent's sub-agent, and so on down --------------------------------------
//
// A grandchild's DISPATCH is not in this thread's transcript — it is in the CHILD's, because the child
// is the one that ran the Agent tool. So neither `subAgents` nor `retiredSubAgents` can ever hold it,
// and the drill-in drawer's lookup used to bottom out at depth 1 (the drawer then states "unavailable",
// which is honest but is also all it could say).
//
// The provider does record it, twice over. Measured on a real three-level broker session
// (`_live_broker_depth.mts`, 2026-07-28 — read that harness's output before changing anything here):
//
//  1. ON THE STREAM. Everything is ONE session: the grandchild's dispatch arrives as an assistant event
//     whose `parentToolUseId` is the CHILD's dispatch id, and the grandchild gets its own task_started /
//     task_progress / task_notification carrying its own taskId + toolUseId. 33 of 50 assistant+user
//     events in that run carried a parentToolUseId, so the link is populated in practice, not in theory.
//  2. ON DISK, which is what this code uses. Beside every child transcript claude writes a SIDECAR,
//     `<session-dir>/subagents/agent-<agentId>.meta.json`, verbatim from that run:
//       {"agentType":"general-purpose","description":"LEVEL-ONE","toolUseId":"toolu_01Tszn…","spawnDepth":1}
//       {"agentType":"general-purpose","description":"LEVEL-TWO","toolUseId":"toolu_01E6L4…",
//        "parentAgentId":"a40cc1902e8ccba6d","spawnDepth":2}
//
// The disk route is the one to build on because the directory is FLAT: a child, a grandchild and a
// great-grandchild all write into the SAME `subagents/` dir of the ROOT session. So "resolve a
// descendant at any depth" is ONE capped directory read keyed by the very dispatch tool_use id the
// drawer is already holding — there is no tree to walk, hence no recursion to bound and no malformed
// parent link that could loop. `parentAgentId` and `spawnDepth` come along for free and are recorded
// here rather than derived, so nothing downstream has to guess at either.

  //   <status>completed</status>
  //   <summary>Agent "Sweep corpus for system-library grants" finished</summary>
  //   <note>A task-notification fires each time this agent stops with no live background children of its
  //   own. The user can send it another message and resume it, so the same task-id may notify more than
  //   once.</note>
  //   <result>I've launched five parallel sweep agents … plus a Monitor … I'll continue once that
  //   notification lands.</result>
  //
  // That child had RESTED holding five live grandchildren, and its own transcript kept appending two
  // minutes later. frizz retired it on the notification (correctly — that is the only terminal signal it
  // gets) and the whole branch went dark: the root's row left every surface, and `rootedInAnchor` then
  // dropped its five RUNNING grandchildren too, because a descendant may only hang off a root the thread
  // still tracks. Six rows of live fan-out, invisible under the prompt box — for 107 s in that session,
  // and only because the coordinator happened to re-steer the child (trackResumes revives on the restart
  // ack); with no re-steer the branch stays invisible for as long as it runs. That is the bug this exists
  // to close, reported by the maintainer as "it totally disappeared from the UI".
  //
  // So a retired child STILL ANCHORS its subtree, and is surfaced as `rested` for exactly as long as
  // something under it is running. It self-retires on the same terms every descendant row does — when
  // the last live grandchild goes quiet, `shown` empties, the anchor produces no subtree, and the row
  // goes away. Nothing can dangle.
  //
  // `killed` is deliberately excluded. That status means the OPERATOR dismissed the row (the × says
  // "stop tracking this finished operation"), a `TaskStop` ended it, or the owning process died and a
  // new session swept it — each an explicit "this branch is over", which frizz must honour over any
  // mtime under it. Only the ambiguous terminals (`completed`/`failed`, the ones a resumable rest also

  // THE SAME REST, OBSERVED AT PRIME INSTEAD OF ON THE EDGE.
  //
  // `onTurnDone` above is the only thing that stamps `rested_at`, and it fires on a LIVE in-flight →
  // idle transition. The prime path has no edge to fire: it folds a whole transcript and ADOPTS the
  // turn it finds. So a turn that ended while frizz was not watching was never recorded as a rest at
  // all, and nothing repaired it afterwards — prime runs once per session per process, so the row kept
  // `rested_at` NULL for the rest of its life while sitting visibly at rest on the board.
  //
  // That window is not exotic. A worker is a DETACHED broker daemon in its own process group, so it
  // keeps working across a frizz restart BY DESIGN (ARCHITECTURE.md) — which makes "the turn ended
  // while frizz was down" the ordinary case every time the server bounces, not an edge.
  //
  // The consequences are all downstream of the column simply being WRONG:
  //   • `snoozeAwaitingBackground` refuses the thread outright — "This thread is not at rest; nothing
  //     to snooze" (router.ts) — on a thread that is plainly at rest, so the card's own Snooze throws;
  //   • `bgSnoozeArmed` (board.ts) requires a non-null `rested_at`, so that snooze can never arm;
  //   • the stored answer to "when did this agent last come to rest" is null for a thread whose
  //     transcript answers it precisely.
  // Measured 2026-08-25 on the maintainer's own board: `examine-the-tickets-in-this-issue` ended its
  // turn at 19:19:26Z with a ```question fence, and after the server bounced it carried `turn: "idle"`,
  // `lastAssistantHasQuestion: true` and `rested_at: NULL` — alone among eleven live threads.
  //
  // A REST IS A FACT; A TURN-DONE IS AN EVENT. Prime records the fact and stays SILENT about the
  // event, which is the whole of the difference from `onTurnDone` and the reason this is not simply a
  // call to it. The silence is deliberate and load-bearing at scale: a rebind can bring back hundreds
  // of historical transcripts on one tick (386 of one project's 427 sessions, measured 2026-08-11),
  // and a notify each would be hundreds of alerts for work that finished days ago.
  //
  // THE CLOCK IS `lastAssistantAt`, NOT `lastActivityAt`, and the difference is the whole safety of
  // this function. `lastAssistantAt` is the rest-time key by construction (see its assignment in
  // applyRecord): it moves ONLY on the agent's own final output, never on a sub-agent's completion
  // notification, a Claude `type:"system"` record, a tool_result echo, a codex `agent-report` or a
  // compaction — all of which advance `lastActivityAt` while leaving the turn `idle`.
  //
  // `onTurnDone` reads `lastActivityAt` and gets away with it because it fires on the EDGE, where the
  // turn-ending record is the last record there is. Prime has no such luck: it folds the WHOLE file,
  // so any trailing activity-advancing record would be baked into the stamp. That is not a cosmetic
  // drift — the monotonic guard below only blocks writes BACKWARDS, so a spuriously later value would
  // overwrite a stamp that was already correct, and `bgSnoozeArmed` (board.ts) holds only while
  // `bg_snooze_rested_at === rested_at`. A restart could then silently un-arm a snooze the operator
  // set on an awaiting-background card, re-surfacing it for a condition that has not occurred.
  //
  // Reading the turn-ending record instead makes a bounce IDEMPOTENT, and by CONSTRUCTION rather than
  // by luck. `lastAssistantAt` moves on a strict SUBSET of the records `lastActivityAt` moves on, so a
  // re-derived stamp can only ever land at or BEFORE the one the live edge already wrote — never after
  // it, which is the one direction the guard cannot block. The two DO disagree in the ordinary case
  // where a `type:"system"` sidecar trailed the `end_turn` inside a single 1s poll window: the live
  // edge stamped the sidecar's instant, prime derives the agent's own. The guard then sees
  // `at <= stamped` and writes nothing, which is the right outcome twice over — the bounce changes
  // nothing, and the instant already stored is the more accurate of the two.
