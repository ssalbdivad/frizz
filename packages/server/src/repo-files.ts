// WHICH OF A THREAD'S WRITTEN FILES BELONG ON THE RAIL: the ones git would carry, and nothing else.
//
// The rail lists what a worker wrote (edited-files.ts). Restricting it to files git is not ignoring is
// the maintainer's product call (2026-09-04): "it's fine to only track changes that are tracked in git
// here". The rail becomes an account of work on the REPOSITORY, and a thread's scratch — `.frizz/`
// notes, plans, research docs — drops out of it along with build output and `node_modules`.
//
// It is deliberately a FILTER and never a SOURCE. Attribution stays with the transcript, which is the
// only place a file can be tied to the session that wrote it: git records what changed and when, never
// WHICH session, and every attempt to infer it put other agents' work on the rail (measured over this
// machine's own history — a thread that wrote 10 files drew 282 from a commit-window sweep, and even
// commits within ±2min of that thread's own `git commit` calls were other agents' CI and wiki work).
// So git answers exactly one question here: is this path one the repository would carry?
//
// NOT-IGNORED, rather than IN-THE-INDEX. `git ls-files` would hide a file until someone ran `git add`,
// so a source file a worker had just created would be missing from the rail for the whole effort and
// appear only after the commit — the moment it is most worth seeing is the moment it would be absent.
// The test is therefore `git check-ignore`, which keeps new work visible and still drops everything
// ignored: build output, `node_modules`, and the thread scratch this rule is aimed at.
//
// ASKED OF THE CHECKOUT THE FILE IS IN. A worker that isolates itself works in a linked worktree, and
// Frizz's own worktree folder is `.frizz/worktrees/<slug>` INSIDE the project — which the project's
// `.gitignore` ignores, as it ignores all of `.frizz/`. Asked in the project root, `check-ignore` read
// every file of every worktree thread as ignored, so the rail of a thread that worked in one was empty
// (review-final #11, 2026-10-02: 22 of 144 sessions in a week ran in `.frizz/worktrees`). The worktree is
// a checkout of the same repository with its own ignore rules applied from its own root, so each path is
// probed there: grouped by the worktree that holds it (thread-cwd.ts liftRepoWorktree — only a worktree
// of the PROJECT'S repository, so an unrelated clone a worker made in its scratch is still judged by the
// project, which ignores it), the project root for everything else inside the project. A sibling
// worktree OUTSIDE the project (`git worktree add ../repo-perf`) is the same repository too, so its files
// are judged by their own checkout rather than passed through.

// Enough for a whole effort's writes; a thread naming more than this is pathological and the tail is not
// worth a second git process.
const MAX_PROBE = 512
// The rail is recomputed on every transcript read, and reads are polled. One `check-ignore` is ~20-50ms,
// which is not free at poll rates, and a `.gitignore` changes far more slowly than a board polls.
