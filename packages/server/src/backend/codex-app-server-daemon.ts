// The detached Codex app-server daemon: ONE per project. It owns the `codex app-server --stdio`
// child and serves its JSON-RPC over a local socket, so the app-server OUTLIVES the disposable frizz
// runtime that spawned it — which is what makes an in-flight codex turn survive Update & Restart.
// It buys Codex the same immunity a Claude thread gets from ITS OWN detached daemon — the session
// broker (claude-broker-host.ts), likewise forked with `detached: true` into its own process group and
// likewise not a child of frizz. That is the mechanism today, and only today: until the multiplexer was
// stripped on 2026-08-02 a Claude thread got the immunity from tmux instead, and an earlier PTY session
// broker had been removed as dead code before that. Nothing here runs a multiplexer.
//
// Before this existed the app-server was an ordinary stdio child of the runtime: every restart
// SIGTERMed it and every in-flight turn died mid-sentence with no `task_complete`, no `turn_aborted`
// and no resume — the thread simply went quiet until a human typed something (diagnosed 2026-07-23,
// and the same event on 2026-07-22 that killed four threads at once).
//
// Launched by ensureCodexAppServerDaemon() in codex-app-server-host.ts, which passes its whole config
// as JSON in FRIZZ_CODEX_APP_SERVER_DAEMON. This process has no stdio (stdio:"ignore"); its only
// interface is the socket and the on-disk record file.

  // to edit the filesystem) for the remaining six hours of IDLE_EXIT_MS is pure waste. Nothing else

  // carry, and it explicitly protects any process named `codex` as a session root
  // (orphan-reaper.ts). Daemons forked from an agent worktree that was later deleted leaked exactly
  // this way, in pairs, at ~150 MB each.
  //
  // The check is gated on being UNATTACHED, and THAT is what keeps it clear of the one property this
  // daemon exists for. A normal Update & Restart never touches the record: the runtime dies, the
  // record sits there untouched, the next generation reads it and reattaches. So the restart window
  // — the one moment nobody is attached — is invisible to this check, because the record still names
  // us throughout it. Two consecutive strikes on top of that, so a single unlucky stat cannot end a
  // turn on its own.
  //
  // Discoverable takes BOTH halves: a record naming us, and a socket path that still leads here. A
  // daemon whose socket file is gone — a successor's sweep before its bind, a $TMPDIR cleaner — still
  // owns the record, but every attach to it fails (the host then drops the record and forks afresh),
