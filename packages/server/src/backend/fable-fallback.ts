// ---- The FABLE FALLBACK (the `fableFallback` setting, off by default) -----------------------------
//
// On a plan where Fable carries its own weekly cap (the endpoint's scoped `weekly-fable` window), the
// base windows — the 5-hour session and the all-models weekly — can run dry while Fable's own budget
// still has room. With the setting on, Frizz spends that room rather than leaving work stalled:
//
//   - a NEW Claude thread dispatched while the base is nearly out launches on Fable (dispatch.ts), and
//   - a thread a base limit has paused restarts on Fable at once instead of waiting out the window
//     (scheduler.ts evalLimits) — the same cold-resume switch the Fable → Opus step-down already uses.
//
// It is the inverse of that step-down, and the two cannot ping-pong: this moves a thread ONTO Fable only
// while Fable reads below FABLE_FALLBACK_HEADROOM_PERCENT, and a thread already on Fable is never moved
// by it. A thread that then caps Fable writes a model-scoped fault, steps down to Opus, and — with the
// Fable window now full — waits for the base window like any other limit.
//
// The thresholds read the same 10%-remaining line the queue's quota warning draws (web quotaAlert.ts),
// so "close to running out" means the same thing on the card and here.
