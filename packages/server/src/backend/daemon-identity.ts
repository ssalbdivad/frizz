// Who a detached daemon's discovery record names — the PROCESS, not just its pid.
//
// Frizz's three daemon families (the Claude session broker, the Codex app-server daemon, the ACP daemon)
// each publish a record carrying `daemonPid`, and each host used to treat "that pid is alive" as "that
// daemon is alive". A pid is not an identity. A reboot kills every daemon without a breadcrumb and
// leaves its record on disk — 8 broker daemons died exactly that way in the 2026-09-23..10-01
// diagnostics corpus — and the next boot restarts the pid counter: the brokers alive on 2026-10-01 sat
// at pids 4555 and 4774, precisely what a fresh boot hands out in its first hour. A stale record whose
// pid a stranger now holds then reads as live, and every consumer acts on it: a reattach to a socket
// that no longer exists, a hibernation sweep that retires it, a Stop that SIGTERMs it — and the Codex
// host escalates to SIGKILL when the "daemon" ignores the TERM.
//
// So a daemon stamps its own birth marker (process-generation.ts) on its record, and a host disowns a
// record only on an EXACT mismatch or a dead pid. Everything weaker keeps the old pid-alive answer,
// because the two mistakes are not symmetric: a wrongly disowned LIVE daemon self-collects within a
// minute (its record no longer names it) and takes any in-flight turn with it.
