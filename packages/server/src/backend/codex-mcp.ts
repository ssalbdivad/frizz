// ---- Codex MCP injection -------------------------------------------------------------------------
// The codex twin of dispatch.ts's `claudeMcpFlags`. Claude mounts frizz's MCP server via one
// `--mcp-config` file named on the worker's argv; codex has no such flag, so it rides a `-c` TOML override
// on the APP-SERVER's argv instead.
//
// WHY THE APP-SERVER'S ARGV. On codex-cli 0.146.0 it was the ONLY channel that worked: putting
// `mcp_servers` in `thread/start`'s untyped `config` bag mounted nothing, and the model answered the
// literal word `NOTOOL` — its own report that the tool was not in its registry. That measurement is
// reproducible via `packages/server/src/backend/_live_codex_mcp_inject.mts`.
//
// THAT IS NO LONGER TRUE, and this file now uses BOTH channels. Re-measured against codex-cli 0.153.2,
// the per-thread override works and gives each thread its own MCP child with its own env — which is
// the only way to tell the server WHO IS CALLING. See `codexThreadMcpConfig` below for what that
// unblocks and why the argv mount is still here.
//
// The app-server is PER-PROJECT (its socket key is sha256(stateDir + projectId)), so one process-level
// mount serves every codex thread in that project with the right FRIZZ_STATE_DIR. Note the app-server
// is long-lived: a change here only reaches NEWLY spawned ones.
//
// `default_tools_approval_mode="approve"` is not optional. Under a restrictive approval policy with no
// approval channel, a mounted MCP call is CANCELLED rather than missing — the log reads
// `mcp: <server>/<tool> started` then `(failed)` + "user cancelled MCP tool call". A headless worker
// has nobody to click that, so without this the tools mount and then fail at the moment of use, which
// is strictly worse than not mounting them.

/**
 * The PER-THREAD `mcp_servers` override for one thread's `thread/start` (and `thread/resume`) config —
 * the same mount as the argv one above, plus the one thing the argv can never carry: WHO IS CALLING.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS AT ALL. The app-server is per-PROJECT and serves every codex thread in it, so the
 * argv mount's env is shared by all of them and cannot name a thread. `FRIZZ_THREAD_SLUG` was therefore
 * simply absent on codex, and every frizz tool that acts on the CALLER'S OWN thread — `title`, `ask`,
 * `done`, `watch`, `watch_pr`, `unask`, `unwatch`, `timer`, `goal`, `activity`, ten call sites through
 * `threadSlug()` in cc-worker/bin/frizz-mcp.mjs — failed at the moment of use with "this frizz MCP
 * server was not told which thread it belongs to". Only `spawn_thread` worked. That is most of the
 * worker contract: a codex worker could not name its own thread, register a question, or sign off, and
 * one of them said so in its own final message ("Frizz's completion registration also failed because
 * the server lacked FRIZZ_THREAD_SLUG; the fence below is the sign-off").
 *
 * WHY IT WORKS NOW AND DID NOT BEFORE. The header above says a per-conversation `mcp_servers` override
 * "does not work: MCP servers are PROCESS-level". That was measured on codex-cli 0.146.0 and it was
 * true then. It is FALSE on 0.153.2, re-measured against the real binary: `thread/start` accepts the
 * override, codex spawns one MCP process per (server × thread), and the child gets that thread's env —
 * two threads started with different slugs produced two children each reporting its own. It also merges
 * with `~/.codex/config.toml` rather than replacing it.
 *
 * THE ARGV MOUNT STAYS, as the process-wide default for a thread that reaches the app-server with no
 * per-thread config (an adopted or pre-upgrade thread), and EVERY resume frizz issues carries this
 * override — the lazy one, adoption, and the boot-time reconcile of a thread that was mid-turn when
 * its app-server died. That last one did not until 2026-09-18, and the claim that the argv mount
 * would then "degrade to tools present, no identity" was measured false the same day
 * (`_live_codex_resume_mcp.mts`, codex 0.155.0 and 0.155.1, stdio and the native listener alike): a
 * thread resumed onto a FRESH app-server gets its MCP children from that resume, the argv entry it
 * fell back to listed the tool, and every call was refused — "MCP tool call requires approval, but
 * approval policy is never" — because the argv entry did not carry the per-entry key below.
 *
 * `default_tools_approval_mode` is repeated ON THE ENTRY, not inherited from the top-level argv key:
 * it is a member of codex's per-server config, and on 0.153.2 a server entry without it was refused
 * with "MCP tool call requires approval, but approval policy is never" under the identical argv that
 * approved the entry carrying it. Both mounts carry it now (serverTable for the argv one).
 *
 * `cwd` is pinned to the project state dir on both mounts. Codex runs a thread's stdio MCP children in
 * the THREAD's cwd unless the entry names its own, and a thread whose recorded cwd no longer exists —
 * a project directory rename, hypergres → porg on 2026-09-18 — gets NO MCP children at all: measured
 * with `STALE_CWD=1`, no child was spawned and the model answered NOTOOL, which is exactly the
 * incident's "no `mcp__frizz__*` in the registry" (the operator's own gmail server survived it
 * because its config.toml entry pins a `cwd`). The state dir exists for as long as the project is
 * registered, and the script reads nothing relative to its cwd. The thread's own cwd is retargeted
 * separately, on resume — see resumeCwdOverride in codex-app-server.ts.
