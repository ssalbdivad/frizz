// The consumer for the structured event stream the Claude broker has always received and thrown away.
//
// The broker daemon runs the Agent SDK with `persistSession: true`, so the SDK writes the session
// JSONL to disk AND hands frizz the same messages as typed events over the socket. Until now the
// bridge forwarded them to a `deps.onEvent` that context.ts never supplied, so every one was dropped
// and the tailer re-derived the identical state by polling that file from disk on a 1–10 s adaptive
// tick. This module is the handler that was missing (plans/t3code-adoption-spike.md item 1).
//
// It does NOT replace the tailer's fold. That fold is the corpus-verified authority for the things
// the board actually renders — signal fences, sub-agents, background shells, auto-titles, delivery
// correlation — and the broker's event projection is strictly lossier than the raw records. Swapping
// one for the other would be a rewrite of the board's derivation with no way to prove it neutral.
// Instead the event stream does the two things a disk poll structurally cannot:
//
//  1. NUDGE. An event means "this session just changed", so the tailer re-reads it now instead of on
//     the next tick. Same fold, same derivation, ~0 ms instead of up to 10 s. This is the change the
//     operator sees: a thread that finishes its turn lands in the queue immediately.
//
//  2. TURN LIVENESS. The SDK states outright when a turn began and when it ended. The tailer's
//     `computeTurn` has to infer both from `stop_reason`, and for an unknown/missing stop_reason it
//     falls back to a 5 s silence backstop — a guess. A `result` event is not a guess. See
//     `resolveRuntimeTurn` for the deliberately narrow way that signal is allowed to matter.
//
// The strict rule for (2), because it is where a DX regression would live: the runtime signal may
// only ever RESOLVE AN AMBIGUITY the fold has not settled. It must never override folded evidence.
// The SDK emits `result` over the socket at some point relative to the final assistant record
// reaching disk, and if a "turn is over" signal were allowed to beat that record to the board, the
// thread would queue with a stale last message and no parsed fence. So a folded `tool_use` (the model
// is definitively mid-tool) always wins over a runtime "settled", and only the backstop case — where
// the fold has no opinion and was going to time out into `idle` anyway — is short-circuited.
//
// (3) SUB-AGENT PROGRESS. The SDK reports child lifecycle as typed `task_*` system messages carrying a
//     description, the tool the child is running right now, a rolling summary and usage — and those
//     messages are STREAM-ONLY, absent from the JSONL the tailer folds. Until now the whole payload was
//     discarded at the protocol boundary, so the tailer reconstructed lifecycle by regex-matching
//     English prose out of launch acks ("output_file:", "Command running in background with ID:") — a
//     path whose own comments record three separate phantom-sub-agent leaks. `tasks()` below is that
//     payload, kept per session; the tailer reads it the same way it reads `liveness()`, as a signal it
//     may consult, and the prose fold stays exactly where it is for pre-broker threads that have nothing
//     else.
