// The Claude Agent SDK REQUIRES an absolute `pathToClaudeCodeExecutable` (validateExecutablePath rejects
// a bare name), unlike an execvp of the CLI, which resolves "claude" on PATH itself. When the dispatch layer
// hands us a bare "claude" (the default when no --claude-bin is configured — the promoted-artifact case),
// resolve it to an absolute path on PATH here, or the forked daemon dies on startup ("executablePath must
// be absolute") before it can publish its record and every dispatch times out with "did not become ready".
//
// WINDOWS is a different problem, and the naive scan below got it wrong. `npm i -g` writes THREE files
// into the bin dir — `claude` (a `#!/bin/sh` script), `claude.cmd`, and `claude.ps1` — because Windows
// cannot symlink the way POSIX npm does. The bare-name scan therefore found the SH SCRIPT and returned
// it: nothing on Windows can run that (spawning it is ENOENT, and `node` reads it as JavaScript and
// dies on line 2). Measured on Windows Server 2022 with claude 2.1.220:
//
//   spawn(<bin>\claude)      -> ENOENT          node <bin>\claude   -> SyntaxError at line 2
//   spawn(<bin>\claude.cmd)  -> EINVAL          (Node refuses .cmd/.bat without shell since CVE-2024-27980)
//   spawn(<real claude.exe>) -> exit 0 "2.1.220 (Claude Code)"
//
// So `.cmd` is not the answer either. The real executable is a NATIVE claude.exe that ships inside the
// package and is NOT itself on PATH — the `.cmd` shim is just a stub that calls it. Hence: prefer a
// real `.exe` on PATH, else find the `.cmd` shim and follow it to the target it invokes.
