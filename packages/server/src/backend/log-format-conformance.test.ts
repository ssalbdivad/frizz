// Conformance gate for the two vendors' TRANSCRIPT FORMATS — the logs Frizz folds to build the board.
//
// This is the sibling of codex-protocol-conformance.test.ts, aimed at the other half of the seam. That
// one asks "do the fields we SEND still exist?"; this one asks "do the fields we READ still exist?" —
// and the second question is the one that has actually cost the product.
//
// WHAT WENT WRONG, and what this would have caught. Codex 0.153 respelled its rollout: every semantic
// event moved onto ONE `event_msg/item_completed` envelope carrying a typed `item`, and the flat
// `agent_message` / `user_message` / `sub_agent_activity` payloads Frizz read were no longer written at
// all. Nothing threw. The fold simply returned EMPTY — zero assistant text, zero user turns, zero
// sub-agents — while the turn brackets, which did not move, kept working. So a thread went in-flight
// and came to rest perfectly, with no title, no preview, no fences and no children on the board. A
// silent-empty failure of exactly this kind cannot be caught by a fixture test: the fixtures were
// captured from the OLD binary and kept passing.
//
// The evidence that DOES catch it is already on the machine. Both vendors stamp their own build into
// the transcript they write — Codex in `session_meta.payload.cli_version`, Claude on every record's
// `version` — so a real transcript written by the PINNED build is a free, unfaked sample of the format
// that build emits. This test finds the newest such transcript and folds it through the production
// path, then asserts the things that went to zero are not zero.
//
// It asserts PRESENCE, never content: that the fold saw records, that it recovered the human's turn and
// the agent's reply, that tools and turn brackets registered. Those are the board's inputs. Nothing
// read here is ever printed — a failure message names a field and a count, never a transcript, a path,
// or a byte of what the operator or the model said.
//
// SKIPS, loudly, when this machine has no transcript from the pinned build: a fresh checkout, CI, or a
// pin that was bumped before anything has run on it. A skip is honest — it says the format is UNPROVEN
// for that pin, which is exactly the state a bump leaves behind until a worker has run. It must never
// read as a pass, so the skip reason names the pin it could not find.
