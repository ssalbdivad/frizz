// The Claude session broker DAEMON: a detached process that owns one Claude Agent SDK session and
// relays it over a local socket. This is the piece Claude Code doesn't ship (codex's app-server is
// the same shape): the session OUTLIVES frizz, so frizz reconnects to the LIVE session after a restart
// instead of cold resume-from-disk, while keeping structured TYPED control (no TUI scraping, no PTY,
// no terminal of any kind — stream-json over pipes). The SDK stays as this daemon's implementation detail; frizz speaks a
// small typed socket protocol (claude-broker-client.ts), never the SDK directly.
//
// Wire protocol — newline-delimited JSON frames:
//   frizz -> broker:  {t:"input", message, requestId?} | {t:"permission", requestId, decision} | {t:"interrupt", ifQueued?} | {t:"set-mode", mode}
//                  | {t:"cancel-input", requestId, id} | {t:"stop-task", requestId, taskId}
//                  | {t:"reload-plugins", requestId} | {t:"rename", requestId, description} | {t:"list-skills", requestId}
//   broker -> frizz:  {t:"hello", sessionId, generation} | {t:"event", event} | {t:"permission-request", requestId, request} | {t:"diagnostic", diagnostic}
//                  | {t:"input-result", requestId, error?}   (only for an input that carried a requestId)
//                  | {t:"cancel-result", requestId, cancelled, error?} | {t:"stop-result", requestId, error?}
//                  | {t:"reload-result", requestId, reloaded?, error?} | {t:"rename-result", requestId, title?, error?} | {t:"skills-result", requestId, skills?, error?}
//
// Control actions that make a user-visible promise are REQUEST/RESPONSE pairs: `cancel-input` carries
// the CLI's verdict about whether a message will still run, and `stop-task` returns only after the SDK
// accepted or rejected the task stop. "We wrote a socket frame" is not either answer. Since
// `input-ack-v1` the same holds for an input: see CLAUDE_BROKER_CAPABILITY_INPUT_ACK.
//
// Lifecycle mirrors codex-app-server-daemon.ts (record-after-listen, owner-checked cleanup, idle
// exit, reachability self-collection). The recovered session-broker daemon's NAIVE unconditional
// cleanup is exactly the corpse-deletes-successor bug this guards against.
