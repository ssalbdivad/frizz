// Client side of the detached Codex app-server daemon (codex-app-server-daemon.ts): discover an
// already-running daemon for this project or fork a new one, then attach to it over its local socket
// and present the attachment as an ordinary `CodexAppServerProcess` so the bridge's JSON-RPC layer is
// unchanged.
//
// The whole point is the lifetime split. `kill()` on this adapter DETACHES the socket; it never kills
// the daemon. So when the disposable frizz runtime is recycled by Update & Restart, the app-server —
// and every turn running inside it — keeps going, and the next runtime generation reattaches to the
// SAME process. (A Claude thread gets the same immunity from its own session broker daemon, which holds
// the SDK session outside frizz entirely — see claude-broker-host.ts. That job belonged to tmux until
// the multiplexer was stripped on 2026-08-02; an earlier PTY session broker had been removed as dead
// code before that.)
//
// A long-lived process needs someone to END it. That is what `stopCodexAppServerDaemon` is for. The
// bridge uses it for version-skew recovery (a daemon caches its `initialize` handshake forever) and
// at an idle turn boundary after auth.json switches ChatGPT accounts (Codex caches AuthManager too).
// See codex-app-server.ts's `connect()` / `ensureCurrentAuth()`. It ends the NATIVE listener too — the
// bridge cannot tell the transports apart, and both kinds of cached process need the same replacement.
//
// Shutdown is deliberately NOT such a caller, for either transport. Recycling frizz must leave the
// app-server (and its in-flight turns) running, which is the whole point of the split above.
