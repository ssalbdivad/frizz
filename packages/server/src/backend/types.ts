// ── CLAUDE_CODE_TOTAL_TOKENS_REMINDER ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// The token budget a Claude worker is TOLD it has. Claude Code's `totalTokensReminder` writes a
// `<total_tokens>N tokens left</total_tokens>` block into the system prompt and after every
// tool-result batch; `infinite` renders the literal `Infinite`. Default is `off` — no block at all.
//
// WHY A FRIZZ WORKER OVERRIDES THAT DEFAULT: with no block, the model has no signal about its budget
// and it GUESSES — badly, and always downward. Claude Code injects nothing else about context: no
// system-reminder in cli 2.1.220 mentions tokens, and the "Context is N% full" warning is `/context`
// TUI text the model never sees. Measured on a real worker (nub session 5258ebe4, transcript line
// 31014) it wrote "I'm near my context limit, so I'm not starting the linker change here" at a live
// fill of 667,277 tokens, against auto-compact boundaries that fired at ~1,000,000 — a third of the
// window still free. Earlier in that same session, 13 consecutive turns declared "I'm out of context"
// at fills of 176k–244k (under a quarter of the window), and at line 20628 it named the pattern
// itself: "I've been treating 'low context' as a stopping condition for the last several turns and
// winding down instead of working." Eight other long worker sessions END at 616k–940k with 25–38% of
// the window unused. Compaction is not cutting these sessions off — they are quitting early.
//
// `infinite` and not `countdown`: a live remaining-token count is still a shrinking number, which is
// the exact input to the bad inference. Claude Code's own autocompact system prompt already tells the
// model "your conversation with the user is not limited by the context window" — `Infinite` restates
// that in the one place the model looks for a budget, and it is TRUE for a frizz worker, whose session
// compacts and continues rather than ending.
//
// The env var is the highest-precedence source, ahead of `totalTokensReminder` in settings and the
// server-side `tengu_lapis_anchor` flag (verified against cli 2.1.220). Its failure mode if dropped
// is a worker that quits at 60% of its window.
//
// ── BASH_DEFAULT_TIMEOUT_MS ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// How long a FOREGROUND Bash call runs before Claude Code moves it to the background. Claude Code's
// default is 120_000 (2 min) with a ceiling of 600_000 (10 min); we sit BELOW both at 60_000, which
// the maintainer chose on 2026-08-01 — reversing the same-day call to take the ceiling.
//
// WHY: the earlier reasoning optimized for the long gate (`nub run test` is ~5 min) and paid for it
// with a turn that can sit blocked for ten minutes on one call. A blocked turn is the worse failure:
// the worker is doing nothing recoverable, the board shows a card that cannot be steered, and the
// operator cannot tell a slow gate from a wedged one. Bouncing at a minute costs a poll cycle to
// recover the result and keeps the turn moving in the meantime.
//
// THAT REASONING STILL GOVERNS THE DEFAULT, and only the default. It is about the call the worker did
// NOT think about: a hung `curl` should bounce in a minute, not sit on the turn. It says nothing about
// a call the worker sized deliberately, which is the case the CEILING below governs.
//
// ── BASH_MAX_TIMEOUT_MS ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// The ceiling on an EXPLICIT `timeout`, lifted from Claude Code's 600_000 to 24 hours on 2026-08-11
// (maintainer: "lift the cap globally, so a worker can block on anything it chooses").
//
// A worker can now block for as long as the thing it is blocking on actually takes. The value that
// makes this safe is not the ceiling, it is that a blocking wait is DELIBERATE: frizz's own watcher
// tools require a timeout, and a Bash call that names one has been sized by a worker that knew what it
// was waiting for. The failure the old ceiling guarded — an opaque turn nobody can distinguish from a
// wedged one — is answered instead by the live tool caption, which names what is running for as long as
// it runs.
//
// 24 HOURS rather than "no limit", because that is already frizz's word for the longest thing a worker
// may ask for anywhere else (RECURRING_MAX_INTERVAL_SECONDS). One ceiling vocabulary, not two.
//
// The Bash tool's own description interpolates both (`` `timeout` is in milliseconds: default ${...},
// max ${...}``), so the worker is told these numbers rather than a stale pair.
//
// This does NOT relax the escaping-background-job rule that hooks/bash-background.mjs enforces. That
// hook is about lifecycle identity (`cmd &` leaves a child frizz and Claude cannot wake on); this is
// only about how long a tracked foreground call is allowed to take before the harness backgrounds it
// ITSELF, which keeps the task id and the wake. The two are independent.
//
// Do not "verify" this value from a stand-in harness: neither `claude -p` nor a raw SDK session
// reproduces the auto-background bounce that real dispatched workers get, so a behavioral check
// there passes identically with and without the variable. See the NOT ASSERTED note in
// _live_sdk_worker_env.mts.
// Claude Code caps WebSearch at 200 calls per SESSION (verified in the 2.1.220 bundle:
// `CLAUDE_CODE_MAX_WEB_SEARCHES_PER_SESSION ?? 200`, enforced in the WebSearch tool against a
// `taskRegistry` counter). A frizz worker is long-lived and research-heavy — it burns that budget on
// work a chat session never would — and past the cap the tool stops searching and merely returns
// "this session has used its web search budget", which reads to the model as a dead end rather than
// as a quota. Raise it far enough that a real effort never hits it, while keeping a finite backstop
// against a runaway search loop; Claude Code has no unlimited sentinel, so a large integer is the
// only expression of "effectively uncapped".
export const WORKER_MAX_WEB_SEARCHES = 10000

// The SAME quiet-cap problem, on the sub-agent path (verified in the same 2.1.220 bundle — all three
// read `Z.<VAR> ?? <default>` through the identical `int({min:1,digitsOnly:true})` parser):
//
//   CLAUDE_CODE_MAX_SUBAGENTS_PER_SESSION  default 200 — TOTAL Task spawns for the whole session.
//     Past it every spawn throws "Subagent spawn limit reached (N of 200 agents spawned)… ask the user
//     to raise CLAUDE_CODE_MAX_SUBAGENTS_PER_SESSION". A frizz worker is long-lived and dispatches a
//     helper per prong across many turns, so it reaches 200 on work a chat session never would — and
//     the failure reads to the model as "stop delegating", not as a quota. Lifted like the search
//     budget: no machine cost to a high ceiling, since this counts spawns over time, not live ones.
//
//   CLAUDE_CODE_MAX_CONCURRENT_SUBAGENTS   default 20 — LIVE agents at once. Past it a spawn throws
//     "Concurrent subagent limit reached… Do not retry", so a fan-out wider than 20 silently loses its
//     tail. Raised, but NOT to the same sentinel: every live sub-agent is a real process and API
//     stream on this machine, so this one is a genuine resource dial (the orphan-reaper work exists
//     because runaway fan-out really does burn the box). 100 clears any real fan-out with a bound left.
//
// NOT lifted: CLAUDE_CODE_MAX_SUBAGENT_SPAWN_DEPTH. Its default is not a constant at all — it resolves
// through a server-gated feature value — but the worker contract already tells workers to keep fan-out
// shallow because a rested sub-agent is not reliably re-woken by grandchildren. Raising the nesting cap
// would buy depth that frizz's own wake path cannot deliver on, so the cap and the contract agree.

//
// The CAPS are the deliberate exception to that masking: a profile override hijacks the worker's

// not a stable source: a worker used to be launched inside a long-lived multiplexer server whose own
