// A durable, append-only record of one Claude broker daemon's lifecycle, written BY THE DAEMON.
//
// The Claude twin of codex-app-server-diagnostics.ts, and it exists for the same reason that file
// gives: the one time death forensics were needed, the bridge's diagnostics were wired to nothing and
// a daemon death was an opaque "the thread went quiet."
//
// The broker had that gap twice over. `onDiagnostic` is plumbed all the way through
// claude-broker-client.ts, but the bridge never supplied a handler — so `{kind:"lifecycle",
// phase:"crashed", message}`, the single most useful line there is, went nowhere. And the daemon only
// wrote diagnostics to an ATTACHED client (`if (client) write(...)`, unlike events, which are
// backlogged), so a crash during a frizz restart — exactly when a detached daemon is most likely to
// die unobserved — was guaranteed lost.
//
// So the DAEMON owns this file, not frizz. A death is precisely when the process may be seconds from
// gone: an in-memory backlog dies with it and a relay needs a listener that a restarting frizz does not
// have. Writing from inside the daemon is the only version that survives the event it is recording.
//
// Deliberately synchronous and best-effort — a logging failure must never perturb the session.

/**
 * Why a broker daemon — and the claude process and every in-flight sub-agent inside it — ended.
 *
 * The codex daemon has carried this vocabulary since the 2026-07-24 six-sub-agent loss
 * (`app-server-exited-code-*`, `self-collected-*`, `signal-*`, `idle-timeout`); the broker's
 * `shutdown()` wrote nothing at all, so a daemon collected by its 6h idle timer, terminated by a
 * signal, or self-collected for unreachability all vanished identically and frizz could only report the
 * generic "the thread went quiet". These are the named causes, one per exit path in
 * claude-agent-broker.ts:
 *
 *  - `frizz-requested`               — RunningBroker.close(); frizz asked for it.
 *  - `signal-SIG*`                  — SIGTERM/SIGINT/SIGHUP, i.e. killBroker or the operator/OS.
 *  - `session-stream-ended`         — the SDK's event stream ended normally (claude exited).
 *  - `session-stream-broken`        — EVENT_ERROR_TOLERANCE consecutive stream errors; genuinely broken.
 *  - `event-pump-failed`            — the pump itself threw outside the per-event guard.
 *  - `idle-timeout`                 — nobody attached for IDLE_EXIT_MS.
 *  - `self-collected-record-reassigned` — unattached and the record no longer names us (a successor
 *                                    stole it, or a sweep removed it): undiscoverable, so collected.
 *  - `self-collected-socket-lost`   — unattached and the socket PATH no longer leads to us (the file
 *                                    was deleted, or another daemon bound it): still recorded, but no
 *                                    client can ever connect again, so collected rather than left to
 *                                    squat on the record every later attach would adopt.
 *  - `socket-listen-failed`         — the listen() that makes this daemon reachable never succeeded.

 *  sessions) that was the ONLY exit reason ever recorded — 277 of 277 — so a hibernation, a Stop, a Mark
 *  as done, a launch-flag retirement, a usage-limit fresh process and an operator's `kill` all read
 *  identically, and the one mark that did name a cause (`.retired`) is consumed by the resume it
 *  explains. On Windows it is worse: `taskkill /F` runs no handler, so a requested teardown there left no
 *  line at all. This record closes both: the signal's sender writes what it meant, with the daemon's
 *  generation, so a reader joins it to the `signal-SIGTERM` that follows. A `signal-SIGTERM` with NO
 *  preceding `terminate` for its generation is then genuinely external.

/** The exit this session's log records for a NAMED daemon, or null when it recorded none for that one.
 *
 *  The log is per SESSION, not per daemon, so a resumed thread's file holds every death across every
 *  generation it has had. "The newest record" is therefore NOT the same question as "how did the daemon
 *  we just lost die" — they diverge exactly when the lost daemon wrote nothing (SIGKILL, OOM, a reboot),

 *  the PREVIOUS generation's cause and timestamp to the current death: measured 2026-08-19, a 21:57:54
 *  SIGKILL reported as "exited (signal-SIGTERM) at 21:55:46" — a wrong answer, in the confident voice of
 *  a right one.
 *
 *  So `generation` is required, and a record that does not carry it is not an answer about this daemon.
 *  Null then means "this daemon left no breadcrumb", which describeClaudeBrokerExit says in as many words
 *  — the honest reading, and the one that sends nobody hunting a cause that belongs to a dead predecessor.
 *  Never gates anything: pure post-hoc attribution for what the bridge would otherwise report as "the
 *  thread went quiet."
 *
 *  An EMPTY generation means the caller could not identify the daemon it lost (a frizz restart with no
 *  record left on disk). That is not a licence to guess: it returns null for the same reason. */
