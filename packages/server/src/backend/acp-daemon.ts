// The detached ACP agent daemon: ONE per ACP thread. It owns the agent child (`opencode acp`,
// `gemini --acp`, …) and serves its JSON-RPC over a local socket, so the agent OUTLIVES the disposable
// frizz runtime that spawned it — which is what lets an in-flight ACP turn, and every sub-agent the
// agent runs inside its own process, survive a Frizz restart or crash. It buys an ACP thread the same
// immunity a Codex thread gets from the app-server daemon (codex-app-server-daemon.ts) and a Claude
// thread from its session broker (claude-agent-broker.ts): forked `detached: true` into its own process
// group, not a child of frizz.
//
// Before this existed the agent was an ordinary stdio child of the runtime: every restart closed its
// stdin and the agent exited with it (the protocol's own teardown), taking the running turn and its
// sub-agents along — the one documented gap between ACP and the other two transports until 2026-09-24.
//
// What the daemon does on the wire, so a RESTARTED bridge can carry on as if nothing happened:
//   - client REQUEST ids are rewritten into the daemon's own id space, so a new client that restarts
//     its counter at 1 can never collide with an id the dead client left in flight; responses are
//     mapped back onto whichever client id currently owns them;
//   - the first `initialize` passes through and its response is CACHED — a reattaching client sends
//     its own `initialize` and is answered from the cache, because ACP initializes a connection once;
//   - the ACP session id is remembered from `session/new`'s result (or `session/load`'s params) and
//     reported in the hello, so the reattaching client adopts the session instead of opening another;
//   - every request still OUTSTANDING (above all a `session/prompt` — the turn) is listed in the hello
//     with its daemon id, and the client re-owns it with an `adopt` control frame naming its new id;
//   - while nobody is attached (the restart window) every child→client line is QUEUED, so the turn's
//     `session/update` stream, its final response and any `session/request_permission` the agent
//     raised meanwhile are replayed, in order, the moment the next runtime attaches.
//
// Launched by forkAcpDaemon() in acp-host.ts, which passes its whole config as JSON in
// FRIZZ_ACP_DAEMON. This process has no stdio (stdio:"ignore"); its only interface is the socket and
// the on-disk record file.
