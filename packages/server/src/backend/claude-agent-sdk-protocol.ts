 * because a bidi control in a rendered tool argument is a spoofing surface, and a control byte in a
 * permission `input` decides what the provider executes. A prompt body is neither: it is the human's
 * own words on their way into a user message's `content` — no shell, no rendering authority, and no
 * framing risk (the broker frame is JSON.stringify'd, which escapes every one of these).
 *
 * U+200D ZERO WIDTH JOINER is `\p{Cf}`, so every multi-part emoji (👩‍💻, 🏳️‍🌈, 👨‍👩‍👧) was refused, along
 * with a pasted BOM, a zero-width space and a soft hyphen. And because the daemon swallowed the
 * refusal (`claude-agent-broker.ts`) the message then VANISHED while frizz's RPC answered success.
 * Measured live in `_live_broker_input_drop.mts`: one sentence delivered plain, and the same sentence
 * disappeared with a single emoji appended. The identical bytes typed straight into a `claude` CLI go
 * through untouched, so the broker path was silently stricter than the provider itself for the same
 * prompt.
 *
 * What stays refused is what is genuinely undeliverable: LONE surrogates (not encodable as UTF-8 on
 * the wire) and the C0/C1 control ranges. Iterating by code point is load-bearing — a valid surrogate
 * PAIR is one astral code point and must pass, which is what makes emoji work at all.
