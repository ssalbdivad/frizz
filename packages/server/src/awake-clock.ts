// ── HOW LONG WAS THE MACHINE ACTUALLY AWAKE? ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Frizz judges silence by the wall clock: a child transcript untouched for 15 minutes reads stale, a turn
// quiet for 15 minutes queues. But when the host sleeps, the wall clock keeps going while every process on
// it is frozen — the agent, its command, and the harness's own `timeout` timer, which runs on a monotonic
// clock. On wake, every quiet child reads dead at once for time nobody spent.
//
// Measured, not assumed (arktype session a627551f, 2026-09-30): a workflow agent's transcript sat still for
// 68 minutes inside a Bash call declaring a 30-minute timeout, and its parent concluded it was probably
// hung. The call's own `uptime` lines read 11:50 → 11:59 across it — nine minutes of machine — and the
// command's report timed its work at 538s. The other 59 were the laptop asleep, and the 30-minute timeout
// never fired because its timer never saw them.
//
// So silence is measured in AWAKE time. A process cannot see its own suspension, but it can see the jump
// afterward: across a suspend the wall clock advances and the monotonic clock (performance.now — frozen
// with the process on Linux and macOS) does not. Sampling both on every tailer tick records each such gap
// as an interval, and a span of wall time minus the intervals inside it is the awake time in that span.
// An NTP step forward reads the same way, and is correctly treated the same: no process timer saw it.
//
// Fails toward the old behaviour. A platform whose monotonic clock counts sleep records nothing, and the
// span is plain wall time again — never shorter than the truth by more than one tick.
