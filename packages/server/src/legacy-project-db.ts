// Until the unified database (see project-scope.ts and frizz-db.ts) every project had its own
// `<stateDir>/ui.db`, and createStorage brought each one up to date on open with the block below:
// the schema as CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS, then a stack of additive ALTERs and idempotent repairs,
// each guarded by its own try/catch or marker. None of that is needed for a database this code
// creates — the unified schema is written complete — but a legacy file is imported by copying its
// rows table by table, and a row can only be copied out of a file whose columns exist. So the block
// lives on here, verbatim, and runs ONCE per legacy file, immediately before its rows are read.
//
// Nothing else may call this. It writes the OLD shape (no project_id), and running it against the
// unified file would add nothing and could re-create a retired table.

  // nothing and is safer than a migration to remove it." That was true for exactly as long as nothing
  // reused the name. 818eeeb3 brought the table back with a DIFFERENT shape, and CREATE TABLE IF NOT

  // build, the orphan survived the upgrade and the next statement in the schema block, the index on
  // (state, expires_at), threw "no such column: expires_at".
