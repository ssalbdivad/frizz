// At every rest where the conversation has moved, write the thread's STATUS from the RECENT conversation.
//
// This began (a7be3046, 2026-09-24) as a periodic RETITLE: a long thread drifts, and by its twentieth
// exchange the operator is steering something the opening prompt never mentioned (maintainer: "every x
// messages on a single thread (maybe 5?), update the summary title … to focus on the recent
// conversation"). That was the right signal in the wrong field. A name that moves every five messages is
// not a name — the reader loses which card is which — so on 2026-09-29 the maintainer split the two: the
// NAME is one or two stable words for the subject (thread-names.ts), and what is happening NOW is a
// separate `status` this pass writes. It NEVER writes the name, whoever set it.
//
// The window is the last few EXCHANGES — the operator's own words plus the agent's replies — not the
// newest line alone (issue #22: a summary fed only the newest reply describes the last agent action).
//
// It ran every 5th operator message until 2026-09-30, and a rested card went on saying "Waiting on npm
// 2FA trust command" for exchanges after the human had run it and the agent had moved on (maintainer:
// "statuses are updated with each interaction so that stale indicators like this dont linger around and
// make users think they need to act when they don't. seems like minimal cost"). So now every rest whose
// transcript gained an agent reply or an operator message since the last write gets one Sonnet one-shot;
// a rest that added nothing — a watcher tick the agent answered with no text — reuses the standing status.
//
// The WINDOW is still the last few operator exchanges. What counts there is the OPERATOR's messages, not every user-role record: frizz's wakes, a child's upward
// `SendMessage`, completion boundaries and still-queued bubbles are all user-side turns nobody typed,
// and counting them would rewrite a quiet thread's status every few watcher ticks. A SPINOFF REQUEST is not
// one either (2026-09-30), though the human asked for it: it is about the NEW thread, so it neither moves
// this thread's conversation on nor names the request live-status.ts should describe this one's work by.
