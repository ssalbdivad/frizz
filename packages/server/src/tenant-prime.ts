// ── OPENING EVERY REGISTERED PROJECT, IN THE BACKGROUND, AFTER BOOT ────────────────────────────────
//
// Tenants activate LAZILY: `routeToTenant` opens a project the first time a request addresses it, so
// a project nobody has visited since boot has no board. That is cheap and it was the right default —
// but a project's queue is a BOARD FACT (All projects, `projectsQueues`, and the rail's badges,
// `projectsRailCounts`, read it off each open project's snapshot), so the consequence the operator
// actually experienced was having to click into every project before it would say how many threads
// were waiting (2026-08-26: "I currently need to click into every project before the badge shows up
// with the number of rested threads!"). A cue you have to visit each project to see is not a cue.
//
// So the server opens the rest of them itself, once, shortly after it starts serving. Three facts make
// that affordable rather than reckless, and they are the whole argument for doing it this way:
//
//   * THERE IS NO EVICTION. `deactivate` is called from shutdown and nowhere else, so a project stays
//     open for the life of the server once anything opens it. The operator visiting all their projects
//     — which is exactly what they are doing today — already reaches this steady state. Priming only
//     reaches it sooner, and without the clicking.
//   * THE COLD PRIME IS ALREADY BOUNDED. `tailer.start()` folds at most MAX_PRIME_ROWS_PER_TICK rows
//     inside PRIME_BUDGET_MS (tailer.ts) and hands the rest to later ticks, so activating a large board
//     costs a few hundred ms here instead of the 1.5-7.5s it cost before that bound existed. The bound
//     covers the whole per-row cost, not only the fold, since 2026-09-04 — see below.
//   * SCHEDULERS FOR EVERY REGISTERED PROJECT IS THE DESIGN, not a side effect. plans/singleton-frizz.md
//     §4 settles it: timers, `awaiting` wakes, snooze expiry, PR watches and limit auto-resume must not
//     go quiet for a project you are not looking at. Lazy activation left them dead until you opened it.
//
// The pass is SERIAL, and the pacing is MEASURED rather than guessed. It shipped with a flat 3s head
// start and a flat 1.5s between projects, which put the last project of 11 on screen 18 seconds
// after boot — and the maintainer rightly asked what the holdup was. Measured on an 11-project stack
// (seven empty, two ~30-thread boards, one 800-thread board with 9.4MB of transcripts), cold tail
// cache:
//
//     empty 11-17ms · 29 threads 37ms · 35 threads 41ms · 800 threads 220ms · TEN PROJECTS: 390ms
//
// The whole pass was 390ms of work behind 16,500ms of waiting. So the delays below are what it costs to
// stay POLITE, and nothing else: one activation is the atomic block (11-220ms, the top end being
// tailer.start's PRIME_BUDGET_MS ceiling), and the pause after it hands the loop back so a request that
// arrived mid-pass is served now rather than after the remaining projects.
//
// The gap TRACKS THE LAST ACTIVATION, the way the tailer's own scheduleTick tracks its last tick: an
// empty project costs a 25ms pause, a big one earns a breather its own size, and nothing pathological
// can hold the pass open for more than PRIME_MAX_GAP_MS. That 50% duty ceiling is also what phases the
// freshly started tailers apart, which the flat gap was really for.
//
// THE 11-220ms FIGURES ABOVE ARE THE 2026-08 MEASUREMENT AND NO LONGER DESCRIBE THIS MACHINE. Twelve
// projects on the maintainer's 2026-09-02 boot took 111-1000ms each, and the pass ran for 18.5s of wall
// clock against 5.7s of summed activation — the difference being the tailer and everything else
// contending for the same loop. See PRIME_MAX_GAP_MS for what that broke and what was done about it.
// The deeper cost was upstream, AND IT IS FIXED (2026-09-04). `tailer.start()`'s first tick used to do
// per-row work BEFORE its budget check — a retiredOps query, a tail-cache hydrate and a stat per
// transcript, plus a read-side discovery pass for anything unbound — so a big board's activation was not
// bounded by PRIME_BUDGET_MS the way the COLD PRIME bullet above assumes it is. The bound is now asked
// before that setup runs rather than only before the fold, and a 558-thread board's first tick fell from
// 2251ms to 342ms with a cold tail cache (1140ms to 359ms warm). The pacing below is still worth having —
// a dozen tailers and everything else share this loop — but it is no longer covering for an activation
// that was an order of magnitude over the figure it paces against.

 * …and the ceiling, so one slow activation cannot pace the whole pass.
 *
 * IT WAS 250ms, AND THAT SILENTLY STOPPED MEANING A 50% DUTY CYCLE. The figure was chosen against the
 * 11-220ms activations measured above, where clamping at 250 never bound anything. Activations are no
 * longer that cheap: the maintainer's own boot log of 2026-09-02 opened twelve projects at 111, 156,
 * 187, 237, 315, 349, 459, 545, 677, 706, 985 and 1000ms. At the old ceiling a 1000ms activation earned
 * a 250ms breather — an 80% duty cycle, not 50% — and the loop stayed saturated for the whole pass. The
 * board RPC measured a 1.19s mean and a 5.60s max while priming ran, against 10ms and 427ms with it off.
 * That is the "long time to load initially": the page the operator is staring at waits behind the
 * projects they are not looking at.
 *
 * 1500ms clears the slowest activation on that log with headroom, so the ratio below is honoured for
 * every project actually observed, while still bounding a pathological one. The pass takes longer in
 * wall-clock and that is the correct trade — the LAUNCHING project is already open and served before
 * this starts, so what the extra seconds buy is a responsive UI while the other badges fill in.

/**
 * How long one activation may hold the pass before the pass moves on without it.
 *
 * THE PASS IS SERIAL, SO ONE SLOW PROJECT USED TO HOLD EVERY PROJECT BEHIND IT CLOSED. On the
 * maintainer's dev server (2026-10-05, which restarts whenever server code lands) `arktype` opened in
 * 13s, 88s and 314s on three boots, and `app`, `beanemachine`, `local` and Home — the projects queued
 * after it — sat "Not open" for that whole span: no badge, no prompt box, and ⌥↑/⌥↓ stepped straight
 * past them (lib/crossProject.ts stepPick only lands on an open project). "Can't access home".
 *
 * So an activation still running after this long is left to finish on its own and the pass carries on.
 * It is not abandoned: `done` still waits for it, which is what keeps shutdown's drain complete (see
 * TenantPrimeRun.stop). Every activation seen on that log except the pathological ones finished well
 * inside it, so an ordinary boot stays exactly as serial as it was.
