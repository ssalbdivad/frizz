// ---- THE PER-THREAD REGISTRIES, READ WHOLE -------------------------------------------------------
// Five little tables hang off a thread — its timers, its PR watchers, its watches, its questions, its
// completion — and the board reads all five for EVERY row it assembles. One query per thread per table
// is fine at ten threads and is not fine at six hundred: measured on a copy of the maintainer's own
// board (558 rows), a single rebuild issued 2,794 statements, of which 2,790 were exactly these five
// asked 558 times each, and took 30.5ms. node:sqlite is SYNCHRONOUS, so that is 30.5ms of blocked event
// loop — and a rebuild fires on a 150ms debounce whenever any agent writes into `.frizz`, plus every
// 15s regardless. On the live server that landed as a board RPC answering in 49-1069ms (median ~270ms)
// against 4.5-10ms on an idle one, and 220 "tick took Nms" warnings in a day.
//
// So the board asks each table ONCE and indexes the answer by slug. These readers are the batched half;
// the per-thread `listX(slug)` calls remain for the worker tools and the scheduler, which genuinely
// want one thread. Each batched statement carries the SAME predicate and the SAME ORDER BY as the
// per-thread one it replaces — that is what makes the two byte-identical, and it is the thing to
// re-check if either statement is ever edited.
//
// Insertion order is what makes the grouping faithful: a Map preserves it, and so does an array push,
// so each bucket comes out in exactly the order the global ORDER BY produced — which is the per-slug
// ORDER BY restricted to that slug, because every one of these orders on columns the slug does not

 * natural key is prefixed with it, and every index leads with it — a tenant only ever asks for its
 * own rows (project-scope.ts), so that is the prefix every lookup has.

  // `allSessions()` is the single hottest operation in the server. It is not a background chore: the
  // tailer calls it TWICE per tick (once at the top of tick(), once inside scanForeign), and the tick
  // is nudge-driven, so on a busy board it runs tens of times a second. A live CPU profile of the
  // maintainer's own server (290 rows, 60 columns) put it at 32% of the entire process — more than half
  // of all tailer time — with node:sqlite's row→object conversion (`plainRow`) alone at 24%. Every tick
  // was re-materialising ~17,000 cells that had not changed, and because a tick runs SYNCHRONOUSLY on
  // the event loop, that cost lands directly on RPC latency and board pushes. The cost also grows with
  // HISTORY, not with live work: 267 of those 290 rows were archived threads nobody was watching.
  //
  // So keep the last read and re-run the query only when the database actually moved. Two cheap probes
  // decide that, and they are deliberately BOTH here:
  //   * `total_changes()` (~0.3µs) counts rows this connection has inserted/updated/deleted. It moves
  //     for any write we made, whatever table — over-invalidating (a `tail_state` flush re-reads the
  //     sessions) but never under-invalidating, which is the only direction that could serve stale rows.
  //     A no-op UPDATE that matches nothing does not move it, so the per-assemble snooze sweep is free.
  //   * `PRAGMA data_version` (~1.8µs) changes only when ANOTHER connection commits. Today one process
  //     owns each project DB, so this never fires; it is here so that if that ever stops being true the
  //     failure mode is a re-read rather than a board frozen forever.
  // Both are read on every call rather than trusting a hand-maintained version counter: there are ~40
  // statements that write this table, and a new one added later must not be able to silently serve
  // stale rows to the board.

  // unchanged), its run count survives with it, and a re-armed loop capped at 3 would stop again on the
  // very next delivery. Clearing `recurring_armed_at` first lets the SET list's own rule do it — a null

  // ON A CLAUDE ROW THE WRITE-BACK ONLY EVER FILLS IN A PROFILE NOBODY CHOSE — it must never overwrite
  // one the operator did choose, which is what the `profile_set_at IS NULL OR backend = 'codex'` clause
  // fences. (`backend = 'codex'` is false for a NULL backend, so a migrated row is treated as claude —
  // the same `row.backend ?? "claude"` convention every other reader uses.)
  //
  // THE ASYMMETRY IS THE WHOLE POINT, and it is about WHEN each backend can honour a pick. Codex takes
  // model/effort per turn, so the very next turn runs on the new pair and the turn_context it writes is
  // a true reading of the operator's choice having landed — observed authority is meaningful there, and
  // the convergence it buys is deliberate (see resolveSessionProfile's tests). Claude fixes them at FORK
  // time: the SDK takes them at query start, so setThreadProfile persists the intent and a live daemon
  // goes on running what it was forked with (router.ts, and the bridge's `held ?? attach`). Every record
  // that daemon writes carries the OLD model and is therefore a reading of a session that STRUCTURALLY
  // cannot have honoured the pick — converging on it overwrites an instruction with a stale fact.
  //
  // Which is what it did, silently, until 2026-09-03: `opus` set on a live thread at 22:36:28 was back
  // to `fable` before 22:40 (`profile_revision` 0 → 1), and the composer's selector reads the same row,
  // so the pick simply vanished with nothing said. The identical write to the same thread once it had
  // stopped emitting held indefinitely — which is the tell that the guard cannot be a timestamp test.
  // "Skip while the pick is newer than the observation" lapses on the very next record a mid-turn thread
  // writes, and the clobber lands anyway.
  //
  // COST, stated because it is real: on a claude row whose profile was set by hand, a model change frizz
  // never made and cannot see — a worker's own `/model`, a provider substituting silently — is no longer
  // learned back. The scheduler's model-scoped fallback is unaffected: it goes through setProfile
  // (evalLimits), which re-stamps the target rather than needing to be observed.
