// THREAD TERMINALS — a live pty that belongs to one thread. The human opens it from the thread's drawer
// (or types `$ cmd` into the thread's prompt box), and it runs in the folder that thread's agent is
// working in: the project root, or the worktree the agent moved into (thread-cwd.ts). It is never a
// thread of its own. It has no row in the rail and no card in the queue; it shows INSIDE its thread
// (the drawer's terminals strip, a mark on the thread's row and card), and it ends with its thread:
// marking the thread done stops every terminal it still has running.
//
// This is the second shape of the feature. It shipped on 2026-09-23 as TERMINAL COMMAND THREADS: the
// prompt box's Terminal tab ran a command as a top-level `kind: "command"` thread with its own row, its
// own queue card and its own Done. That was reversed on 2026-09-29 (maintainer: prompt threads are the
// only top-level thread kind; terminals hang off a thread), for two reasons Colin raised upstream: a
// standalone terminal ran in the project root and so ignored which worktree an agent was actually in —
// Frizz deliberately leaves the worktree choice to the agent, so the terminal has to follow it — and
// every terminal was one more row in a sidebar whose whole value is density. The table is still called
// `command_thread` (renaming a table buys nothing and costs a migration); `parent_slug` is what makes a
// row a thread's terminal, and a row without one is a pre-2026-09-29 command thread, archived at boot.
//
// The pty rides the hardened /term/<id> transport (terminal.ts): ONE process per terminal, a bounded
// replay so a tab that opens late (or reloads) sees the screen so far, and a subscriber set so two tabs
// watch the SAME process rather than each starting one.
//
// node-pty IS LOADED LAZILY, on the start path only. It is a native addon, and upstream removed it on
// 2026-09-24 because a static `import "node-pty"` killed every Linux/WSL install at boot (#42): a failed
// native load took the WHOLE server down, every project with it, for a feature most boards never touch.
// So nothing here imports it at module load. A start that cannot load it records a failed run whose
// screen says why, which is where the human who pressed "Open terminal" is already looking.
//
// WHAT IS DURABLE AND WHAT IS NOT. The row — its thread, the command, the folder, how its last run ended —
// lives in SQLite, so the thread keeps it across a restart. The process does not: a pty is a child of this
// server, and replacing the control plane (Restart Frizz, an update) closes the pty master and hangs the
// process up. Boot records every run that never reported an exit as interrupted, so the strip says
// "interrupted" and offers Restart rather than showing a process that is not there.
//
// ONE WAY A TERMINAL REACHES THE QUEUE: A RUN SITTING AT A PROMPT. `npm publish` stopping at "Enter
// one-time password:", an ssh passphrase, a `[y/N]` — the process is alive and will stay alive forever,
// and the human is the only one who can move it. See `awaitingInput`; the board queues the PARENT thread
// on it (board.ts withThreadTerminals), since the terminal has no card of its own to queue.

// How long a run must be silent, sitting on an unterminated line, before it reads as waiting for input.
// Long enough that a program between two writes of one line (a spinner frame, a slow `printf`) is not
// mistaken for a prompt; short enough that the card is up before the human has looked elsewhere.
