// THE EDITOR BRIDGE — the server end of `/_frizz/editor`, the socket every VS Code / Cursor / Windsurf
// window running the Frizz extension (packages/vscode) dials. Design: ARCHITECTURE.md § VS Code extension; the
// wire: @frizz/shared editor-protocol.ts.
//
// ONE PER MACHINE, like the server. index.ts builds it once beside the tenant map and answers the
// upgrade before tenant routing, and every project's router reaches it through `ctx.editors`: a
// window's folders can span several projects, and a file link clicked in any project's page has to be
// able to land in any window.
//
// What it holds is small and all in memory: the connected windows (their folders, focus and app, and
// what their editor last showed, for the agents), the requests waiting on a window's answer, and the
// selections an editor sent to the prompt box until a page claims one. Nothing survives a restart, and
// nothing needs to — the extension reconnects and says it all again.
//
// And it tells ONE window when a thread needs the human (`attention`): it listens on every open
// project's bus for the board's own needs-you edge while a window wants to hear it, and hands each one
// to the window the human was in last of those that have the project open.
