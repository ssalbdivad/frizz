// THE SAME COMPLETION, DELIVERED TWICE, WITH A REST IN BETWEEN.
//
// The runtime routinely delivers a background shell's completion twice: once while the agent is still
// mid-turn, and again afterwards as the thing that RE-INVOKES it. De-duping the second is right while
// the agent never stopped in between — and deletes the only explanation the reader has when it did.
//
// Measured on `investigate-nubjs-nub-642` (maintainer 2026-08-17: "the agent came to rest, but then it
// starts up again, and I have no idea why. What restarted it? Kind of mysterious"): shell `bfpp19dew`
// drew its divider at 07:10:15 mid-turn, the agent rested at 07:10:24.613 on an ```awaiting fence naming
// that shell, and the SAME completion arrived 46ms later and restarted it — landing in the
// already-consumed branch and rendering nothing. The transcript read [rest] → [work], with no cause.
