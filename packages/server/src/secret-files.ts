/**
 * Where a SECRET answer goes instead of the database — the value the human pasted into a masked card
 * (`mcp__frizz__secret`): a one-time code, a token, a password.
 *
 * NOT A FILE. The path the worker is given is a NAMED PIPE (a FIFO, 0600 in a 0700 dir under the
 * project's state dir), and the value lives only in this process's memory. When a reader opens the pipe
 * the value is written into it once — through the kernel, never onto disk — and the pipe is removed. So:
 *
 *   - nothing persists: no plaintext for a backup, a sync client or a later `grep` to find;
 *   - it is SINGLE USE: the first `cat` gets it, and the path is gone after;
 *   - it EXPIRES: an unread value is dropped after SECRET_TTL_MS, and a server start clears every pipe
 *     a previous process left (no writer can stand behind one, so a reader would block forever).
 *
 * The worker's command is unchanged from the plaintext-file version this replaced (2026-10-08): it reads
 * the value inside the command that uses it, `--otp "$(cat '<path>')"`, and the transcript carries only
 * the path.
 *
 * HOW THE WRITE FINDS ITS READER. Node has no blocking-free way to wait for a FIFO's reader, and a
 * blocking open would hold a libuv thread until one came. So a timer tries a NON-BLOCKING write-open
 * every POLL_MS: with no reader it fails with ENXIO and nothing happens; with one it succeeds, the value
 * (far below a pipe's buffer) goes in whole, and the close gives the reader its EOF. So OPENING the path
 * spends the value, read or not — a reader blocks in its open until this writer arrives, and is present
 * for the write — while looking at it (`ls`, `test -p`) does not. A reader gone between the open and the
 * write raises EPIPE, and the value is kept for the next one.
 *
 * WINDOWS HAS NO FIFOs. There the value is a 0600 file, removed at the same TTL and at the next start —
 * the weaker shape, kept so the tool works rather than refusing.
