// ---- WHERE A FORKED THREAD'S OWN TRANSCRIPT BEGINS (2026-09-30) ----------------------------------
//
// On a Claude thread, Spinoff FORKS the parent's session (router.ts forkSpinoff): the child is a new
// session that opens on a copy of the parent's whole conversation, so it starts with the parent's full
// context and reads the parent's prompt cache. Measured on CLI 2.1.284 / Agent SDK 0.3.282, the child's
// `<sessionId>.jsonl` is laid out as
//
//     mode · atis-latch · queue-operation enqueue/dequeue (the child's own prompt, queued)
//     … every record of the parent's conversation, rewritten under the CHILD's session id …
//     attachment hook_success (the child's own SessionStart)
//     user  ← the child's first prompt, `uuid` = the id Frizz sent it under   ◀── the fork point
//     … the child's own work, including the CLI re-appending the INHERITED `ai-title` …
//
// Nothing marks a copied record as inherited, and a reader that folds the file from byte 0 hands the
// child its parent's state: the parent's fence and done card as the child's rest, its background shells
// and sub-agents as the child's, its sign-offs and questions, its unread turns, its title. So every
// reader of a forked thread's transcript starts at the FORK POINT — the line of the record whose uuid is
// the child's `fork_anchor` (storage.ts) — and reads NOTHING until that record has landed. That makes a
// fork look, to every fold, exactly like a fresh dispatch whose transcript opens on its prompt.
//
// The anchor is a uuid Frizz minted for the child's opening prompt, which the CLI echoes onto the
// record (the same echo the delivery ledger correlates on), so no copied record can carry it — however
// the CLI treats the copied records' own uuids (2.1.284 keeps them; the run that motivated this change
// reported them re-minted). The records the child wrote BEFORE its prompt (the queue pair, its
// SessionStart hook) are skipped with the copy; none of them is state any fold keeps.
//
// The CLI also re-appends session metadata after the child's prompt from what it loaded, so the PARENT's
// `ai-title` (and a `custom-title`, when the parent was renamed) turns up again past the fork point.
// The scan records the last of each it passed in the copy, and `inheritedMetadata` names them, so a
// reader can drop exactly those — a title the child's own session generates is a different string.
//
// The scan is incremental and memoized per file: a transcript is append-only, so once found the point
// never moves, and while it is still pending each call reads only what was appended since the last one.
