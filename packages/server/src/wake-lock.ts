// ── KEEP THE MACHINE AWAKE WHILE AN AGENT IS WORKING ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// An agent left running overnight stopped for 8h 35m because the HOST idle-slept (arktype a627551f,
// 2026-10-02): Windows logged "entering sleep, Sleep Reason: System Idle" at 01:38 — its AC plan sleeps
// after an hour without input — and woke at 10:14 on a keypress. WSL froze with it, and so did every
// agent, sub-agent and benchmark it hosted. A background process does not count as activity to any
// desktop OS's idle timer, so a machine doing hours of agent work reads as idle to the one thing that
// decides whether it sleeps.
//
// So while any thread has work RUNNING on this machine, the server holds the OS's own "system required"
// request, and drops it the moment nothing is. Only IDLE sleep is blocked: closing the lid, the power
// button and an explicit Sleep still sleep, and the display still turns off. What counts as running is
// `keepsAwake` below — deliberately local compute only. A thread parked on a PR, an issue or a timer is
// waiting on the world, not on this machine; it catches up on wake, and holding a laptop awake for a
// 180-day PR watch would be absurd.
//
// The request is held by a CHILD PROCESS, never by this one, for two reasons: Node has no binding to
// any of the three platform APIs, and a child ties the request's lifetime to its own. Each helper
// below exits when its stdin closes, so a server that crashes or is SIGKILLed releases the request
// with it — the OS never sees an orphaned hold.
