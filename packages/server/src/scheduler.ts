// ---- THE DURABLE WAKER ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// NOTHING IN AN ```awaiting FENCE WAKES A THREAD. A fence STATES what a thread is waiting on; every
// wait frizz can actually fire is a REGISTRATION the worker made through a tool — a `thread_timer` row
// (`mcp__frizz__timer`), a `pr_watch` row (`mcp__frizz__watch_pr`, SOURCE 11), a background shell's own
// telemetry — or a condition the server itself observes: a provider limit lifting, a human's snooze
// coming due, a recurring prompt's schedule, a rest with nothing declared. The limb that polled
// `pr-watch:`/`pr:`/`ci:`/`timer:` hints out of the fence was hardwired off by the 2026-08-15 grammar
// cut and deleted on 2026-08-24, because a line frizz cannot check is a wait that can silently never
// resolve. Any other automated wait should stay ACTIVE instead, through Bash/Monitor (Claude) or a
// blocking exec wait (Codex).
//
// ---- THE BOOT-MASS-FIRE SAFETY GUARD (critical — the maintainer has ~14 real sessions) ----
// We fire ONLY on a wait REGISTERED with this scheduler, and every registration is persisted before it
// can fire — so a timer crossing or PR activity during downtime still wakes after a restart, while a
// thread that merely inherited an old transcript has registered nothing and therefore wakes nothing.
// Once a condition fires, a deterministic SQLite outbox row is committed BEFORE terminal delivery.
// Atomic leases serialize multiple scheduler instances; delivery acknowledgement, transcript-token
// confirmation, and per-source supersession produce explicit terminal states. A crash leaves
// pending/leased work recoverable instead of burning a fired bit before the wake reached the worker.

// and the GitHub actions are still running, then that should remain in the running active rail. Only if
// CI has failed or completed successfully should it show up back in the queue").
//
// `none` and `running` are deliberately different answers. An EMPTY rollup means no check has reported
// yet, which `evalRollup` already treats as pending — but a PR with no CI at all would then wait
// forever for checks that are never coming, so the two are split here: `none` lets the thread queue
// immediately, `running` is what parks it.
//
// A PASS NOW REQUIRES SOMETHING TO HAVE ACTUALLY PASSED, and nothing may be waiting for approval
// (2026-09-04). Both halves are the same defect read twice: the old reading answered "did anything
// present go red?" when the question is "did this commit get built?". Skips and label bots are not a
// build, and a workflow nobody has approved has not run. `gated` folds into `running` rather than
// earning a fifth verdict word — the queue rule (board.ts, groups.ts) asks only whether CI has SETTLED,
// and a gated PR has not — but it is counted and named separately, because "waiting for a maintainer to

//     sit at/below 85% is the genuine down-edge while ignoring tick-to-tick jitter near 100%.
//   • the MIN FAULT AGE — the served quota reading can lag the fault by up to its cache TTL, and during
//     a fast fleet burn the window climbs 85→100 in well under a minute, so a reading OLDER than the
//     fault could still show pre-burn headroom. Only trusting the signal once the fault is comfortably
//     older than that staleness guarantees the reading POST-dates the fault (a real recovery), not a

// ---- SOURCE 4: THE RECURRING PROMPT, ON SCHEDULE --------------------------------------------------
// SOURCES 4 and 5 are two TRIGGERS on ONE stored prompt (`recurring_*`), not two features. They stayed
// two scheduler passes through the merge because they genuinely do not fold together: this one keys its
// delivery id on (generation, beat index) and must NOT filter on rest, while SOURCE 5 keys on
// (generation, rest instant) and must. One pass with a mode flag would be both of them wearing an if.
//
// THE DUMB TRIGGER: a prompt on a chosen clock. It consults nothing about the thread — not rest, not
// `--awaiting`, not sub-agents, not shells. If the interval has elapsed, a delivery is queued, and it
// GOES OUT whether or not the thread is mid-turn (`isDeliverableNow`, which carries the transport
// detail). It is the only source that does not wait for rest, and that is the feature.
//
// It is the sibling of SOURCE 5, not a rival: the rest trigger asks "you stopped — is there more?" and
// only a thread that stops ever hears it; this one asks "it has been an hour" and a thread hears it an
// hour later, working or not. An operator who needs a thread revisited on a schedule regardless of what
// the agent is doing needs this one.
//
// It also remains the only recurring wake a worker CAN have. Claude Code's own `CronCreate` /
// `ScheduleWakeup` cannot fire in the runtime frizz spawns: their gate stays shut while ANY background
// task is outstanding, so the thread most in need of a nudge — one parked behind a sub-agent that will
// never report — is exactly the one whose cron is dead (measured 2026-08-01: 3 fires in 150s with no
// background work, 0 with a background shell alive). Riding frizz's outbox sidesteps that entirely.
//
// Its record of intent is the session row, with `recurring_armed_at` as the GENERATION: re-arming mints
// a new one, so a delivery still in the outbox under the old settings reads as superseded.
//
// It never ABORTS the turn it lands in. Both transports accept a mid-turn message as an ordinary
// queued/steered input, so the running work finishes and the prompt is read at the next sampling
// boundary — which is what "fires on its cadence" means, and is also the only reading compatible with
// frizz's completion invariant.
//
// THE FENCE PREFIXES ARE THE PRE-MERGE ONES, on purpose. They are internal delivery-id namespaces that
// nothing outside this file reads, and renaming them would reclassify every delivery already sitting in
// a live outbox as an unknown fence across the upgrade — real churn to buy a nicer string.

// ---- WHAT A PENDING QUESTION DOES TO THE THREE TRIGGERS -------------------------------------------
// NOTHING, as of 2026-08-16. A Goal fires over an unanswered question fence, a native ask and a
// permission prompt alike, on every trigger, and there is no setting that changes it.
//
// THAT IS A DELETION, not a default flip. The row carried a `recurring_pause_on_questions` column and the
// footer panel showed it inverted as an "Autonomous mode" switch; both are gone. Maintainer 2026-08-16:
// "I feel like the stop hook should just fire even when there are open questions, unconditionally, and we
// could just drop the AutonomousMode toggle… If somebody enables the stop hook goal, then that kind of
// implies to me that they don't really want to answer any more questions." Arming a Goal IS the consent
// the switch used to collect, so collecting it twice only bought a way to get it wrong — and the hold's
// original job (a half-finished thread resting silently, with nobody to bring it back) belongs to the
// built-in sign-off nudge now (SOURCE 9), which fires on exactly the rests that need it.
//
// WHAT STILL STOPS A BUMP is `restMessageIsSignedOff` below, and it is about the FENCE rather than about
// questions: the stop hook asks "you stopped — is there more?", and a ```done or an ```awaiting on a wait
// somebody else owns has already answered it in the very message that ENDED the turn. Firing over either
// is the trigger talking to itself. A ```question fence used to be a third limb of that rule and no
// longer is — it is an answer only for a thread that is waiting on a human, and a thread carrying a Goal
// is not.
//
// Its two surviving limbs reach different distances. A ```done fence ends the arrangement, so it also
// stops the HEARTBEAT (`saidDone`) — it is the successor to the ALLDONE sentinel and inherits its reach
// exactly. A parked ```awaiting stops the stop hook alone: the heartbeat asks "it has been an hour" and
// the compaction trigger asks "your context is gone", and a PR nobody has reviewed is an answer to
// neither. A `human:` gate stays held for the same reason it always did — bumping one is measured harm
// (see `parkedOnAWaitItCannotAdvance`) and the fix for it is the operator, not a bump.
//
// THE BUMP THAT CROSSES A QUESTION SAYS SO. A worker handed the bare goal on top of its own unanswered
// question re-asks it, correctly — so `restPromptMessage(prompt, {overQuestion:true})` tells it no answer
// is coming and to record the call instead. Without that clause this would produce the duplicate queue
// card the old hold existed to prevent, rather than the forward motion asked for.
//
// THE `done` CARVE-OUT IS THE LOOP'S OFF SWITCH, and is the one thing here that is not negotiable: the
// delivered trailer tells the worker to sign off with `done` to stop the prompts, so a goal that kept
// firing over a `done` fence would be a loop with no terminating condition that frizz had also promised
// terminates. Predictability cuts the other way here — an unconditional trigger is only simpler until it
// is the thing reopening finished threads.

 *  but it never applied to these two shapes, and firing over them was a self-feeding loop rather than a

 *  `pr-watch: colinhacks/zod#6382` was bumped 7 times in 46 minutes, each bump costing a turn whose only
 *  product was the SAME fence reworded, because "keep going" has no answer while a PR sits unreviewed. A
 *  second thread added `human: Colin to merge — the task barred me from merging` and was bumped anyway,

 *
 *  WHAT STILL GETS THE RESCUE: an `awaiting` fence with no items at all, an unparseable PR ref, a timer

 *  (`mcp__frizz__watch_pr`) will fire, so the Goal holds; a `prs:` entry with no registration behind it
 *  is a park frizz cannot honour, so it gets the rescue like any other unfireable item. Without the first
 *  half this reintroduces the measured loop above verbatim.
 *
 *  (The quoted incident keeps the spelling of its day: `pr-watch:` was the fence key until 2026-08-15,

// minutes" is the instruction being obeyed. See `isDeliverableNow`.

// aborts the running turn nor opens a new one (the CLI drains its queue at the next sampling boundary).

  // Frizz's own stop hook. Always on, not disableable per-thread, and invisible in the UI — orthogonal
  // to the operator's Goal, which keeps its own three triggers.
  //
  // THE PER-THREAD OFF SWITCH WAS TRIED AND REVERTED (2026-08-13 → 2026-08-14): the Goal's then-existing
  // "Autonomous mode" silenced this for a day, on the argument that a thread told to keep going should not
  // also be handed a menu of ways to stop. What killed it is that the reminder no longer IS that menu — it
  // opens by sending a half-finished thread back to the work — and that suppressing it took the
  // ```awaiting park with it, which nothing else on that thread's deliveries names. That switch is gone
  // entirely now (2026-08-16), so re-deriving the exemption would silence this on EVERY thread with a Goal.
  // The maintainer's 2026-08-12 call stands: keep it separate from the Goal, enabled all the time. (Until
  // 2026-08-28 that meant paying one extra transcript record per rest, both going out together; the
  // record turned out to arrive stale and draw a second ```done. Now the GOAL stands down on the rest
  // this takes — evalRestPrompts — and this never stands down for the Goal.)
  //
  // It fires on a rest that carried NO FENCE AT ALL, and its message is the sign-off protocol itself.
  // The rules therefore arrive at the one moment they are about to be used, rather than 200k tokens
  // earlier in a system prompt the agent stopped attending to (maintainer 2026-08-11: "the agent seems
  // to often forget about this stuff when it's added to the additional system prompt anyway"). A thread
  // that signs off correctly never sees it, so the mechanism costs nothing except on exactly the rests
  // that were about to produce an item nobody can triage.
  //
  // THE CAP IS CONSECUTIVE AND IT IS NOT OPTIONAL. An agent that rests bare, is told how to sign off,
  // and rests bare again would otherwise be told forever — a nag loop frizz itself generates. After
  // SIGNOFF_NUDGE_MAX in a row with no fence appearing, it gives up and the item sits in the queue as a
  // plain bare rest, which is exactly today's behaviour.
  //
  // ONLY A FENCE GIVES THE ALLOWANCE BACK. This used to say a new word from the HUMAN did too, on the
  // reasoning that their message is a new task and the count was about the old one — but that was written
  // before the delivery-id fix below, and the code has never done it. It cannot: frizz's own nudge lands
  // as a USER record, so "the human spoke" is a condition the nudge satisfies by nudging, which is the
  // 22-deliveries-in-four-minutes loop that fix exists to close. The consequence is worth stating plainly
  // rather than leaving as a footnote — on a thread with a Goal armed, two bare rests exhaust this
  // permanently, and everything after is the Goal alone.
  //
  // TOP-LEVEL THREADS ONLY — a sub-agent's final message is a report to its parent, not a queue item.

      // AND `lastUserAt`. Keying on either meant the nudge minted a fresh delivery id for a rest that
      // had not happened, and reset its own consecutive counter with its own message: measured on a real
      // stack, 22 deliveries in four minutes to one thread. The cap could not save it, because the thing
      // being counted was resetting the count.
      //
      // `lastAssistantAt > lastUserAt` is the honest question — did the AGENT end the exchange? — and it
      // is immune to anything frizz says, because frizz only ever speaks as the user. A thread whose last
      // word is frizz's own nudge is a thread that has not answered it yet.
      // Same trap as the stop hook's: a signed-out provider answers instantly, so the failure LOOKS like
      // a fenceless rest and satisfies every guard above. Teaching it to sign off cannot help — it never
      // reached the model.
      // AND THE GENERAL CASE OF IT, which the auth guard above is one instance of. A FAILED TURN IS NOT A
      // REST: a synthetic API-error record is written as an assistant record, so it advances the rest
      // instant and satisfies every guard above, and a thread whose every turn fails therefore presents
      // as an agent that keeps resting without a fence. The nudge cannot be answered — nothing the agent
      // writes reaches the model — so it is pure burn, and on the error this matters most for it is
      // WORSE than pure burn: a 400 for a conversation that has outgrown the model's context window is
      // made permanent by anything that appends to the conversation, which is exactly what the nudge
      // does. Observed unbounded in the field before the cap was fixed to bind at all; both fixes are
      // needed, because the cap alone still spends two deliveries on a thread that can never use them.
      // ANY fence means the thread already said where it stands — including `awaiting`, which is still
      // a legitimate sign-off until the registry replaces it. Nothing to teach, AND the allowance comes
      // back: signing off is the only event that proves the nudge worked, and the only one frizz cannot
      // cause by nudging. (Guarded on a non-zero count in storage, so this is a transition, not a write
      // on every tick.)
      //
      // A REGISTRATION SAYS IT JUST AS LOUDLY, and since 2026-08-27 it is how a worker is meant to say
      // it: `done` records a row, `ask` records a row, `watch` records a row, and none of the three can
      // write the tailer's `lastFence`. Reading only the fence would nudge a worker for not writing a
      // sentence it was told to replace with a tool call — which is the protocol reminder teaching the
      // OLD protocol, on exactly the threads that adopted the new one.
      //
      // AND AN ANSWER ON ITS WAY COUNTS TOO, which is the case this guard read wrong for a day. Every
      // registration test above opens the INSTANT the human answers — the row leaves `open` and nothing
      // has replaced it yet — so the very next tick nudged a worker for resting without a fence while its
      // answer was still in the outbox. The transcript then read: the worker's rest, "FRIZZ ASKED FOR A
      // SIGN-OFF", then the human's answer (maintainer 2026-08-27, on exactly that sequence). It also
      // spent one of the two nudges this thread will ever get on a thread that had done nothing wrong.
      //
      // A CANCELLATION ON ITS WAY IS THE SAME CASE FROM THE OTHER DIRECTION (2026-09-02): arming a Goal
      // dismisses the open questions wholesale, which turned a rest that had signed off WITH a question
      // into what this pass reads as a bare one — so the nudge took the rest ("you rested without a
      // fence", to a worker whose question frizz itself had just cancelled) and the Goal stood down for
      // it. The armed-rest flag scopes it to exactly the threads whose dismissals wake on their own.
      //
      // AN OPEN QUESTION IS A SIGN-OFF ONLY AT THE REST THAT ASKED IT (upstream 2026-10-05). A question
      // CARRIED from an earlier rest is not this rest's sign-off: its card stays where it was asked, so the
      // worker names it under `questions:` in an awaiting fence (evalParkIntegrity) or withdraws it, and is
      // told so below (carriedQuestionsNudgeMessage). One the human typed past is set aside and holds
      // nothing — it is withdrawn at this rest unless the worker `keep`s it, and a keep counts as asking
      // it again (board.carriedQuestionRows, shared questionRepliedPast).
        // A wait on ANOTHER THREAD's answer (`message_thread` with `await_reply`) is a registration like a
        // watch: the tool tells the worker to rest on it with nothing else, so it must count here too…
        // …and so does a thread's message ON ITS WAY, the twin of the answer-in-flight case above: the
        // answer CANCELS the wait the instant it is sent, so until it is delivered the rest reads bare.
        // Seen on a real run (2026-09-29): the nudge was merged into the very delivery carrying the answer.
      // A native ask is a question by another route: the thread is frozen on a modal the human has to
      // answer, and telling it to write a ```question fence is telling it to do what it already did.
      // The sentinel still ends the arrangement for sessions that predate the fence (see `saidDone`).
      // IT DOES NOT YIELD TO THE GOAL, and that is a deliberate reversal (maintainer 2026-08-12: "we
      // should keep it separate from goal… It should just be enabled all the time"). The reminder used
      // to ride the Goal's at-rest trailer so a rest produced one delivery instead of two — but that
      // made the protocol a thing a thread only learned if an operator had armed a Goal, and put a copy
      // of it in the trailer, which is its own kind of repetition. It is frizz's own hook now: identical
      // on every thread, whatever the operator has configured.
      // THE GOAL YIELDS TO IT INSTEAD (2026-08-28). "The second delivery costs one transcript record"
      // was the accounting here until then, and it was wrong: the two went out in one tick, 5 ms apart,
      // the runtime queued the Goal's turn first, and this message — "you rested without a fence" —
      // reached a worker that had just answered the Goal WITH one. It fenced again; two Done cards. The
      // supersession check in `deliveryContext` exists for exactly that and could not fire, because it
      // ran at send. So this pass mints first in the tick and SOURCE 5 declines the rest it took.
      // AND NO GOAL-SHAPED EXEMPTION HERE — see the SOURCE 9 header for the day it had one.
      // THE CONSECUTIVE CAP. It counts fenceless rests and is cleared ONLY by a fence (above) — never by
      // a user record, because frizz's own delivery is one, and anchoring on that let the nudge reset its
      // own counter with its own message.
      //
      // UNDER THE ANSWER-REQUIRED CONTRACT (2026-10-01; `status:` since 10-05) the fence decides the queue, so the reminder

  // awaiting park draws them in its own table, and a done card's "Mark as done" ends the session, and
  // every shell with it, the moment the human archives it.
  //
  // A shell under an armed `watch` is kept on purpose and is not listed. Nothing is killed here — a dev
  // server the human is about to open looks exactly like a forgotten poller from outside, so the worker,
  // which knows which one it is, decides.
  // ---- A QUESTION THE HUMAN WROTE PAST IS WITHDRAWN AT THE WORKER'S NEXT REST ---------------------
  //
  // A typed message sets every open question aside (shared questionRepliedPast). Until 2026-10-02 a
  // set-aside card then stayed open and answerable in the thread's history indefinitely, which the
  // maintainer found far too persistent: "questions shouldn't hang around if I progress the
  // conversation … unless the agent determines the question is directly relevant to what I said, it
  // should be withdrawn and a new question can be asked if needed."
  //
  // So the set-aside state now lasts exactly ONE TURN — the one the message started. While it runs the
  // card stays answerable (the human may still be mid-answer), and the worker, which reads the message as
  // frizz cannot, `keep`s whatever is directly relevant to it. At the first rest after the message, every
  // question still set aside is withdrawn. A danger question never reads as set aside, so it is never
  // withdrawn here.
  //
  // THE REST GUARDS ARE THE SIGN-OFF NUDGE'S: idle, and the agent spoke after the human's message AND
  // after the last user record — so a message delivered but not yet read, or a wake landing on top of the
  // rest, waits for the rest that follows it. A failed turn is not a rest.
  //
  // `settled_at` is stamped with the MESSAGE's instant, not now: the message is what withdrew it. That
  // also keeps the row out of router.pivotTwin, which refuses re-asking a question withdrawn AFTER the
  // human's newest message — the worker's own unask on reading it. An expiry is nobody's decision, so a
  // later turn that genuinely needs the answer may ask again.

  //     items is UNLIMITED (maintainer 2026-08-15) — a three-hour build under a one-hour estimate is a

  // ---- SOURCE 11: THE REGISTERED PR WATCHERS ------------------------------------------------------
  // A worker registers a pull request with `mcp__frizz__watch_pr` and frizz brings it back whenever
  // something happens on it (maintainer 2026-08-14: "The agent should have a tool to register a PR
  // watcher… it should get notified when CI either succeeds or failed and on follow-up reviews and
  // comments").
  //
  // IT REPORTS REPEATEDLY, which is what makes it unlike every other source here. A timer rings once and
  // is spent; this one stays armed across CI going red, a fix, CI going green and a reviewer's comment —
  // four wakes from one registration. So the delivery id carries a REPORT NUMBER: keyed on the watcher
  // id alone, the outbox would dedupe every wake after the first and the watcher would look broken from
  // the second event onward.
  //
  // ONLY A CHANGE FIRES. The cursor holds what has already been reported — the review activity ids, and
  // the last check verdict announced — so a poll that finds the same red CI and the same three comments
  // says nothing. A watcher that re-reported its own last message on every tick is a nag loop with an
  // API bill.
  //
  // THE FENCE IS NOT CONSULTED HERE, deliberately. Registration is a tool call and watching is a fact;
  // the ```awaiting fence separately STATES what the thread waits on, and a thread with no fence at all
  // is woken exactly the same way.

  // ---- SOURCE 13: A BACKGROUND SHELL OUTLIVED ITS RUNTIME BUDGET ----------------------------------
  // Maintainer 2026-09-29: "background shells running for 16 hours makes no sense." A shell carries a
  // budget only when one was DECLARED (shell-budget.ts — its launch `timeout`, or an `extend_shell`; there
  // is no default, and an armed `watch` holds the deadline to its own expiry). An unbudgeted shell is
  // never looked at here. For a budgeted one, two steps, both keyed on the durable `shell_budget` row,
  // so neither is lost to a restart nor repeated by one:
  //
  //  1. PAST THE DEADLINE → one warning wake, delivered mid-turn if the worker is busy, and the row
  //     marked warned FOR THIS DEADLINE. An extension moves the deadline, so the next overrun is warned
  //     afresh; the same deadline is never warned twice, however many passes or restarts see it.
  //  2. GRACE AFTER THE WARNING REACHED THE WORKER, deadline unmoved → the shell is stopped through the
  //     operator's own × path, and the worker told why. Grace counts from the warning's DELIVERY — not
  //     the deadline, and not the instant it was queued — so neither a server that was down across the
  //     deadline nor a wake that waited in the outbox eats into the worker's window to answer. See
  //     shellBudgetGraceFrom for how "delivered" is read.
  //
  // A shell frizz cannot stop (a pre-broker row, or no task id yet) is warned and never killed — the
  // warning says so. An ARCHIVED thread is nobody's to wake: it gets no warning and no kill notice, but
  // its shell still ends on the same clock, because a forgotten shell on a shelved thread is exactly the
  // 16-hour case. A kill that fails is retried, spaced, rather than every tick.

  // WHEN THE WARNING REACHED THE WORKER — the instant its grace runs from, or null while it is still on
  // its way (nothing may be stopped yet). Read off the warning's own outbox row, which is durable, so a
  // restart reads the same answer. Until 2026-09-29 the grace ran from `warned_at`, the instant the
  // warning was QUEUED: two shells due 8s apart on a real stack had their warnings delivered ~5m apart
  // (the quiet window, since exempted — wake-store.ts), and the second worker got ~5 of its 10 minutes.
  //
  //  · SENT to a live runtime, or DELIVERED → the handoff instant (`sentAt`, else `deliveredAt`). A sent
  //    row is still leased awaiting confirmation; the worker has it, so its clock is running.
  //  · PENDING, or leased and not yet sent → null. That includes a frame that was sent and LOST (its
  //    runtime died with no token) and is going round again: the worker never read it.
  //  · TERMINAL without reaching the worker (exhausted, abandoned), or NO ROW (an archived thread is
  //    never warned; a pruned row) → `warned_at`. Nobody can be told, and a shell whose worker cannot
  //    be reached is exactly the forgotten one the budget exists for, so it ends on the original clock
  //    rather than living forever behind a wake that will never land.
  //
  // Looked up under the thread's CURRENT session: a warning queued under an earlier one is not found
  // and falls to `warned_at`, the old behaviour, for a thread that restarted mid-grace.

  /** THE ANSWER DELIVERY PASS. The human answered on the board; this is what puts it in front of the

   *  process was down has to survive the gap, or it is lost in exactly the silence the fenced question
   *  used to lose the QUESTION in.
   *
   *  ONLY AN ANSWER WAKES. A dismissal is real news ("decide it yourself") but it wakes nobody: the
   *  human dismissing questions is almost always dismissing several in a row and is sitting right there,
   *  so a wake per x would be a turn per click. Dismissals RIDE the next answer's message instead, and
   *  a thread with nothing but dismissals simply keeps them queued — the worker sees them gone in its
   *  own `ask` read-back.
   *
   *  MARKED DELIVERED WHEN THE WORKER HAS IT, not when the outbox does (2026-10-01). This used to flip
   *  `delivered` at ENQUEUE, on the reasoning that the outbox is durable and owns retry from there — but
   *  the outbox's retry is capped, and a wake that exhausts its attempts is filed and forgotten. On
   *  2026-09-30 four answers on one thread were flagged delivered and never reached its worker (a broker
   *  resume race, fixed in 0dc073b7); had every attempt failed, nothing anywhere would ever have offered
   *  them again. Now each settlement records the wake carrying it (`delivery_id`), `delivered` flips only
   *  when that wake reaches the outbox's `delivered` state (settleQuestionAnswers), and a settlement whose
   *  wake ended any other way is offered again:
   *    - IN FLIGHT (its wake pending or leased): skipped, so a second answer on the same thread is its
   *      own wake and never re-carries the first — the double-send the enqueue-time flag used to prevent.
   *    - LANDED but not yet marked (a process that died between the outbox's confirm and the mark): marked
   *      here.
   *    - FAILED (exhausted, abandoned, or superseded): offered again under a NEW fence id (the old one
   *      is spent — the outbox dedupes on it), when there is a reason to think it can land now. A wake
   *      superseded before it crossed the transport (the session moved; the thread was archived and is
   *      back) goes at once; a wake the runtime refused waits for this process to be newer than the
   *      failure, for the worker to have run a turn since, or for ANSWER_REOFFER_BACKOFF_MS. A brand-new
   *      settlement on the thread is a delivery opportunity too: the failed ones ride it.
   *
   *  ANSWERS ARRIVE A QUESTION AT A TIME (2026-09-29) and are delivered as they come, so the worker starts
   *  on the first while the human reads the rest. Three things keep that from costing a turn per card:
   *  every undelivered answer a pass finds for a thread goes as ONE message (below); an answer goes out
   *  mid-turn like a typed steer instead of waiting for the rest and opening its own turn
   *  (isDeliverableNow); and answer rows that piled up while none could go fold into one message at
   *  claim (adoptCompanions). A kick that lands during a pass runs one more pass after it (`kick`), so an
   *  answer stored while the previous one's delivery is in flight is picked up at once.

  // A delivery is a turn, and a turn is the expensive unit (wake-store.ts, WAKE_QUIET_WINDOW_MS, for the
  // numbers: $2–3 each at today's context sizes, 32% of a day's spend). The quiet window makes a thread's
  // wakes WAIT together; this is what makes them GO together. When a claim passes its gates, every other
  // pending row for the same thread and session is examined on its own terms — its own `deliveryContext`,
  // so a row whose fence or rest was superseded settles as superseded and one already confirmed by the
  // transcript settles as confirmed, exactly as they would have alone — and every row that could go out
  // right now is LEASED beside the carrier (`adopt`, which ignores the quiet window: the carrier is
  // leaving anyway) and folded into the carrier's message under its own reason line, in creation order.
  //
  // THE ROWS STAY SEPARATE. Only the message is merged: each companion keeps its own row, attempts,
  // lease and terminal state, and every outcome of the one `resume` — deferred, abandoned, sent, acked
  // — is applied to the whole frame, row by row. That is what keeps the two invariants that matter
  // intact without a new state or column: the per-fence dedupe (a merged-away timer's row reaches
  // `delivered` under its own fence id, so `evalTimers` finds it and never re-mints; a merged-away
  // report's row is there for `undeliveredPrWatchReport` to see), and the settle hooks (a merged-away
  // timer is marked fired, a merged-away snooze disarmed, by the same `settleDelivered` the carrier gets).
  // A frame that is LOST — the process died before it read the frame — goes round again row by row and
  // is simply re-merged by the next claim; nothing is delivered on the strength of a message that was
  // composed and never read.
  //
  // AN ANSWER NEVER MERGES WITH ANYTHING BUT ANOTHER ANSWER. `questionAnswerMessage` is the human's own
  // words in a shape the chat parses by position — its first line must be the answers header and every
  // trailing line is read as the last answer's continuation — so wrapping it in a heading or appending
  // anything after it would render frizz's prose inside the human's answer chip. It is exempt from the
  // quiet window for the same reason it cannot wait.
  //

  // answer the scheduler found at once already went as one message (evalQuestionAnswers groups a
  // thread's undelivered answers); what that missed is answers that piled up as SEPARATE rows while none
  // could go — the worker's process down, its telemetry unreadable, a delivery failing and retrying. Each
