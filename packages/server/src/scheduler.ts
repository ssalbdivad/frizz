// ---- THE DURABLE WAKER ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// NOTHING IN AN ```awaiting FENCE WAKES A THREAD. A fence STATES what a thread is waiting on; every
// wait frizz can actually fire is a REGISTRATION the worker made through a tool — a `thread_timer` row
// (`mcp__frizz__timer`), a `pr_watch` row (`mcp__frizz__watch_pr`, SOURCE 11), a background shell's own
// telemetry — or a condition the server itself observes: a provider limit lifting, a human's snooze
// coming due, a recurring prompt's schedule, a rest with nothing declared. The limb that polled
// `pr-watch:`/`pr:`/`ci:`/`timer:` hints out of the fence was hardwired off by the 2026-08-15 grammar
// cut and deleted on 2026-08-24, because a line frizz cannot check is a wait that can silently never
// resolve. Any other automated wait should stay ACTIVE instead, through Bash/Monitor (Claude) or a
// blocking exec wait (Codex).
//
// ---- THE BOOT-MASS-FIRE SAFETY GUARD (critical — the maintainer has ~14 real sessions) ----
// We fire ONLY on a wait REGISTERED with this scheduler, and every registration is persisted before it
// can fire — so a timer crossing or PR activity during downtime still wakes after a restart, while a
// thread that merely inherited an old transcript has registered nothing and therefore wakes nothing.
// Once a condition fires, a deterministic SQLite outbox row is committed BEFORE terminal delivery.
// Atomic leases serialize multiple scheduler instances; delivery acknowledgement, transcript-token
// confirmation, and per-source supersession produce explicit terminal states. A crash leaves
// pending/leased work recoverable instead of burning a fired bit before the wake reached the worker.

// and the GitHub actions are still running, then that should remain in the running active rail. Only if
// CI has failed or completed successfully should it show up back in the queue").

// `none` and `running` are deliberately different answers. An EMPTY rollup means no check has reported
// yet, which `evalRollup` already treats as pending — but a PR with no CI at all would then wait
// forever for checks that are never coming, so the two are split here: `none` lets the thread queue
// immediately, `running` is what parks it.
//
// A PASS NOW REQUIRES SOMETHING TO HAVE ACTUALLY PASSED, and nothing may be waiting for approval
// (2026-09-04). Both halves are the same defect read twice: the old reading answered "did anything
// present go red?" when the question is "did this commit get built?". Skips and label bots are not a
// build, and a workflow nobody has approved has not run. `gated` folds into `running` rather than
// earning a fifth verdict word — the queue rule (board.ts, groups.ts) asks only whether CI has SETTLED,

//   • the MIN FAULT AGE — the served quota reading can lag the fault by up to its cache TTL, and during
//     a fast fleet burn the window climbs 85→100 in well under a minute, so a reading OLDER than the
//     fault could still show pre-burn headroom. Only trusting the signal once the fault is comfortably
//     older than that staleness guarantees the reading POST-dates the fault (a real recovery), not a

// ---- SOURCE 4: THE RECURRING PROMPT, ON SCHEDULE --------------------------------------------------
// SOURCES 4 and 5 are two TRIGGERS on ONE stored prompt (`recurring_*`), not two features. They stayed
// two scheduler passes through the merge because they genuinely do not fold together: this one keys its
// delivery id on (generation, beat index) and must NOT filter on rest, while SOURCE 5 keys on
// (generation, rest instant) and must. One pass with a mode flag would be both of them wearing an if.
//
// THE DUMB TRIGGER: a prompt on a chosen clock. It consults nothing about the thread — not rest, not
// `--awaiting`, not sub-agents, not shells. If the interval has elapsed, a delivery is queued, and it
// GOES OUT whether or not the thread is mid-turn (`isDeliverableNow`, which carries the transport
// detail). It is the only source that does not wait for rest, and that is the feature.
//
// It is the sibling of SOURCE 5, not a rival: the rest trigger asks "you stopped — is there more?" and
// only a thread that stops ever hears it; this one asks "it has been an hour" and a thread hears it an
// hour later, working or not. An operator who needs a thread revisited on a schedule regardless of what
// the agent is doing needs this one.
//
// It also remains the only recurring wake a worker CAN have. Claude Code's own `CronCreate` /
// `ScheduleWakeup` cannot fire in the runtime frizz spawns: their gate stays shut while ANY background
// task is outstanding, so the thread most in need of a nudge — one parked behind a sub-agent that will
// never report — is exactly the one whose cron is dead (measured 2026-08-01: 3 fires in 150s with no
// background work, 0 with a background shell alive). Riding frizz's outbox sidesteps that entirely.
//
// Its record of intent is the session row, with `recurring_armed_at` as the GENERATION: re-arming mints
// a new one, so a delivery still in the outbox under the old settings reads as superseded.
//
// It never ABORTS the turn it lands in. Both transports accept a mid-turn message as an ordinary
// queued/steered input, so the running work finishes and the prompt is read at the next sampling
// boundary — which is what "fires on its cadence" means, and is also the only reading compatible with
// frizz's completion invariant.
//
// THE FENCE PREFIXES ARE THE PRE-MERGE ONES, on purpose. They are internal delivery-id namespaces that
// nothing outside this file reads, and renaming them would reclassify every delivery already sitting in
// a live outbox as an unknown fence across the upgrade — real churn to buy a nicer string.

// ---- WHAT A PENDING QUESTION DOES TO THE THREE TRIGGERS -------------------------------------------
// NOTHING, as of 2026-08-16. A Goal fires over an unanswered question fence, a native ask and a
// permission prompt alike, on every trigger, and there is no setting that changes it.
//
// THAT IS A DELETION, not a default flip. The row carried a `recurring_pause_on_questions` column and the
// footer panel showed it inverted as an "Autonomous mode" switch; both are gone. Maintainer 2026-08-16:
// "I feel like the stop hook should just fire even when there are open questions, unconditionally, and we
// could just drop the AutonomousMode toggle… If somebody enables the stop hook goal, then that kind of
// implies to me that they don't really want to answer any more questions." Arming a Goal IS the consent
// the switch used to collect, so collecting it twice only bought a way to get it wrong — and the hold's
// original job (a half-finished thread resting silently, with nobody to bring it back) belongs to the
// built-in sign-off nudge now (SOURCE 9), which fires on exactly the rests that need it.
//
// WHAT STILL STOPS A BUMP is `restMessageIsSignedOff` below, and it is about the FENCE rather than about
// questions: the stop hook asks "you stopped — is there more?", and a ```done or an ```awaiting on a wait
// somebody else owns has already answered it in the very message that ENDED the turn. Firing over either
// is the trigger talking to itself. A ```question fence used to be a third limb of that rule and no
// longer is — it is an answer only for a thread that is waiting on a human, and a thread carrying a Goal
// is not.
//
// Its two surviving limbs reach different distances. A ```done fence ends the arrangement, so it also
// stops the HEARTBEAT (`saidDone`) — it is the successor to the ALLDONE sentinel and inherits its reach
// exactly. A parked ```awaiting stops the stop hook alone: the heartbeat asks "it has been an hour" and
// the compaction trigger asks "your context is gone", and a PR nobody has reviewed is an answer to
// neither. A `human:` gate stays held for the same reason it always did — bumping one is measured harm
// (see `parkedOnAWaitItCannotAdvance`) and the fix for it is the operator, not a bump.
//
// THE BUMP THAT CROSSES A QUESTION SAYS SO. A worker handed the bare goal on top of its own unanswered
// question re-asks it, correctly — so `restPromptMessage(prompt, {overQuestion:true})` tells it no answer
// is coming and to record the call instead. Without that clause this would produce the duplicate queue
// card the old hold existed to prevent, rather than the forward motion asked for.
//
// THE `done` CARVE-OUT IS THE LOOP'S OFF SWITCH, and is the one thing here that is not negotiable: the
// delivered trailer tells the worker to sign off with `done` to stop the prompts, so a goal that kept
// firing over a `done` fence would be a loop with no terminating condition that frizz had also promised
// terminates. Predictability cuts the other way here — an unconditional trigger is only simpler until it
// is the thing reopening finished threads.

/** The thread SIGNED OFF: the message that ended the turn declares the work finished.

 *  (`lastUserAt` for a registered done, the final assistant message for a fenced one). Arming a Goal
 *  writes no transcript record, so a human who armed one on a thread that had already signed off got a

 *  `pr-watch: colinhacks/zod#6382` was bumped 7 times in 46 minutes, each bump costing a turn whose only
 *  product was the SAME fence reworded, because "keep going" has no answer while a PR sits unreviewed. A
 *  second thread added `human: Colin to merge — the task barred me from merging` and was bumped anyway,
 *  until it escaped the loop the only way left to it: a ```done fence on a PR nobody had merged. The
 *  trigger corrupted the signal it exists to produce.
 *
 *  WHAT STILL GETS THE RESCUE: an `awaiting` fence with no items at all, an unparseable PR ref, a timer

 *  is a park frizz cannot honour, so it gets the rescue like any other unfireable item. Without the first
 *  half this reintroduces the measured loop above verbatim.
 *
 *  (The quoted incident keeps the spelling of its day: `pr-watch:` was the fence key until 2026-08-15,

  // Frizz's own stop hook. Always on, not disableable per-thread, and invisible in the UI — orthogonal
  // to the operator's Goal, which keeps its own three triggers.
  //
  // THE PER-THREAD OFF SWITCH WAS TRIED AND REVERTED (2026-08-13 → 2026-08-14): the Goal's then-existing
  // "Autonomous mode" silenced this for a day, on the argument that a thread told to keep going should not
  // also be handed a menu of ways to stop. What killed it is that the reminder no longer IS that menu — it
  // opens by sending a half-finished thread back to the work — and that suppressing it took the
  // ```awaiting park with it, which nothing else on that thread's deliveries names. That switch is gone
  // entirely now (2026-08-16), so re-deriving the exemption would silence this on EVERY thread with a Goal.
  // The maintainer's 2026-08-12 call stands: keep it separate from the Goal, enabled all the time. (Until
  // 2026-08-28 that meant paying one extra transcript record per rest, both going out together; the
  // record turned out to arrive stale and draw a second ```done. Now the GOAL stands down on the rest
  // this takes — evalRestPrompts — and this never stands down for the Goal.)
  //
  // It fires on a rest that carried NO FENCE AT ALL, and its message is the sign-off protocol itself.
  // The rules therefore arrive at the one moment they are about to be used, rather than 200k tokens
  // earlier in a system prompt the agent stopped attending to (maintainer 2026-08-11: "the agent seems
  // to often forget about this stuff when it's added to the additional system prompt anyway"). A thread
  // that signs off correctly never sees it, so the mechanism costs nothing except on exactly the rests
  // that were about to produce an item nobody can triage.
  //
  // THE CAP IS CONSECUTIVE AND IT IS NOT OPTIONAL. An agent that rests bare, is told how to sign off,
  // and rests bare again would otherwise be told forever — a nag loop frizz itself generates. After
  // SIGNOFF_NUDGE_MAX in a row with no fence appearing, it gives up and the item sits in the queue as a
  // plain bare rest, which is exactly today's behaviour.
  //
  // ONLY A FENCE GIVES THE ALLOWANCE BACK. This used to say a new word from the HUMAN did too, on the
  // reasoning that their message is a new task and the count was about the old one — but that was written
  // before the delivery-id fix below, and the code has never done it. It cannot: frizz's own nudge lands
  // as a USER record, so "the human spoke" is a condition the nudge satisfies by nudging, which is the
  // 22-deliveries-in-four-minutes loop that fix exists to close. The consequence is worth stating plainly
  // rather than leaving as a footnote — on a thread with a Goal armed, two bare rests exhaust this
  // permanently, and everything after is the Goal alone.
  //
  // TOP-LEVEL THREADS ONLY — a sub-agent's final message is a report to its parent, not a queue item.

      // on every tick.)
      //
      // A REGISTRATION SAYS IT JUST AS LOUDLY, and since 2026-08-27 it is how a worker is meant to say
      // it: `done` records a row, `ask` records a row, `watch` records a row, and none of the three can

      // sentence it was told to replace with a tool call — which is the protocol reminder teaching the
      // OLD protocol, on exactly the threads that adopted the new one.
      //

  //
  //  1. IT NAMED SOMETHING THAT IS NOT RUNNING. Checked the moment the fence lands. The bump says WHICH,
  //     because "your fence is wrong" sends a worker to re-read its own transcript for an id it has
  //     already lost, and that is exactly how it got the id wrong the first time.
  //  2. IT RAN OUT. `for:` elapsed and nothing resolved. The worker is brought back to re-check
  //     everything rather than the wait simply continuing, and re-parking on the same still-running
  //     items is UNLIMITED (maintainer 2026-08-15) — a three-hour build under a one-hour estimate is a
  //     bad estimate, not a failure, and each bump is a real checkpoint where it could decide otherwise.

  // ---- SOURCE 11: THE REGISTERED PR WATCHERS ------------------------------------------------------
  // A worker registers a pull request with `mcp__frizz__watch_pr` and frizz brings it back whenever
  // something happens on it (maintainer 2026-08-14: "The agent should have a tool to register a PR
  // watcher… it should get notified when CI either succeeds or failed and on follow-up reviews and
  // comments").
  //
  // IT REPORTS REPEATEDLY, which is what makes it unlike every other source here. A timer rings once and
  // is spent; this one stays armed across CI going red, a fix, CI going green and a reviewer's comment —
  // four wakes from one registration. So the delivery id carries a REPORT NUMBER: keyed on the watcher
  // id alone, the outbox would dedupe every wake after the first and the watcher would look broken from
  // the second event onward.
  //
  // ONLY A CHANGE FIRES. The cursor holds what has already been reported — the review activity ids, and
  // the last check verdict announced — so a poll that finds the same red CI and the same three comments
  // says nothing. A watcher that re-reported its own last message on every tick is a nag loop with an
  // API bill.
  //
  // THE FENCE IS NOT CONSULTED HERE, deliberately. Registration is a tool call and watching is a fact;
  // the ```awaiting fence separately STATES what the thread waits on, and a thread with no fence at all
  // is woken exactly the same way.

  // Maintainer 2026-09-29: "background shells running for 16 hours makes no sense." Every shell carries a
  // budget (shell-budget.ts — its launch `timeout`, else 1h; `extend_shell` moves it). Two steps, both
  // keyed on the durable `shell_budget` row, so neither is lost to a restart nor repeated by one:
  //
  //  1. PAST THE DEADLINE → one warning wake, delivered mid-turn if the worker is busy, and the row
  //     marked warned FOR THIS DEADLINE. An extension moves the deadline, so the next overrun is warned
  //     afresh; the same deadline is never warned twice, however many passes or restarts see it.
  //  2. GRACE AFTER THE WARNING, deadline unmoved → the shell is stopped through the operator's own ×
  //     path, and the worker told why. Grace counts from the WARNING, not the deadline, so a server that
  //     was down across the deadline still gives the worker its full window to answer.
  //
  // A shell frizz cannot stop (a pre-broker row, or no task id yet) is warned and never killed — the
  // warning says so. An ARCHIVED thread is nobody's to wake: it gets no warning and no kill notice, but
  // its shell still ends on the same clock, because a forgotten shell on a shelved thread is exactly the
  // 16-hour case. A kill that fails is retried, spaced, rather than every tick.

  // wakes WAIT together; this is what makes them GO together. When a claim passes its gates, every other
  // pending row for the same thread and session is examined on its own terms — its own `deliveryContext`,
  // so a row whose fence or rest was superseded settles as superseded and one already confirmed by the
  // transcript settles as confirmed, exactly as they would have alone — and every row that could go out
  // right now is LEASED beside the carrier (`adopt`, which ignores the quiet window: the carrier is
  // leaving anyway) and folded into the carrier's message under its own reason line, in creation order.
  //
  // THE ROWS STAY SEPARATE. Only the message is merged: each companion keeps its own row, attempts,
  // lease and terminal state, and every outcome of the one `resume` — deferred, abandoned, sent, acked
  // — is applied to the whole frame, row by row. That is what keeps the two invariants that matter
  // intact without a new state or column: the per-fence dedupe (a merged-away timer's row reaches
  // `delivered` under its own fence id, so `evalTimers` finds it and never re-mints; a merged-away
  // report's row is there for `undeliveredPrWatchReport` to see), and the settle hooks (a merged-away
  // timer is marked fired, a merged-away snooze disarmed, by the same `settleDelivered` the carrier gets).
  // A frame that is LOST — the process died before it read the frame — goes round again row by row and
  // is simply re-merged by the next claim; nothing is delivered on the strength of a message that was
  // composed and never read.
  //
  // AN ANSWER NEVER MERGES, as carrier or as companion. `questionAnswerMessage` is the human's own words

  // line is read as the last answer's continuation — so wrapping it in a heading or appending anything
