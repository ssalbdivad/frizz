// THE MACHINE'S LIST OF PROJECTS.
//
// One Frizz per machine needs something no per-project server ever did: a list of every project, to
// draw a grid of them and to route `/<slug>` at one of them. That list did not exist — the mapping
// only ever ran repo → id, with no reverse index, and 38 of this machine's 46 state directories have
// no on-disk record of which repo they belong to at all.
//
// THIS FILE IS AN INDEX, NOT IDENTITY. The id lives in the project, at `.frizz/.id` (project-root.ts),
// and that stays the source of truth. Everything here is derived from it and rebuildable by opening a
// project again — which is what makes a machine-level file acceptable at all after the deliberate
// choice to keep identity local. Delete registry.json and you lose card ordering and URL slugs, not
// a single thread.
//
// Keying on the id rather than the path is what makes a project SURVIVE BEING MOVED: `~/.frizz/
// projects/<id>/` already holds every thread, log and attachment, so a path-keyed registry would have
// to re-key all of that on a `mv` or keep a path → id map anyway. The id is already the spine.
//
// It also buys back the duplicate-checkout self-heal that went out with `identity.json`: an id found
// at a path the registry does not know, while the path it DOES know still exists, means someone
// `cp -R`'d a project. Copying is the one case the id-in-the-tree design cannot distinguish on its
// own, and the registry sees it for free.

 * only way to fill it is to visit every repository in a terminal, which is precisely the chore one
 * server for the machine was supposed to end. Everything needed is already on disk: each state dir is
 * named for its project id and records the directory it was opened from.
 *
 * CONSERVATIVE ON PURPOSE. A state dir is adopted only when the project STILL CLAIMS THAT ID. It may
 * claim it either way Frizz has ever stored one: `.frizz/.id`, or the older `git config frizz.id`.
 * Checking only the file was a real bug — boron and pullfrog/app both predate the gitless change and
 * had never been reopened since, so they carried a git-config id and no file, and the backfill
 * silently skipped two of the four projects actually in use (2026-08-06). A checkout that has since been re-identified (copied,
 * or re-created after a delete) is skipped rather than guessed at, because the cost of guessing is a
 * card that opens the wrong board. Same for a directory that no longer exists.
 *
 * DUPLICATES ARE REAL. Two ids can name one path — a project deleted and re-opened leaves the old
 * state dir behind, and this machine had two for nub and two for boron. The `.frizz/.id` check
 * settles it: only the id the project currently claims is adopted.
 *
 * Runs once at boot and is idempotent: a path already registered is left exactly as it is, so an

/**
 * Rename a project's DIRECTORY to a sibling basename, and re-register it there.
 *
 * The one first-party way to change the folder itself. The id travels with the tree, so this is the
 * "moved" case `registerProject` already reconciles — the difference is that Frizz did the move and
 * knows about it at once, rather than learning at the next `frizz` run. Off by default in the rename
 * dialog: a folder is the operator's, and renaming Frizz's card must never rename it uninvited.
 *
 * A basename only — no separators, no `.`/`..` — so this can rename a folder and cannot move one
 * somewhere else. The target must not exist: `rename(2)` onto a directory either fails or, on some
 * platforms, replaces an empty one, and neither is what "rename" means here.
