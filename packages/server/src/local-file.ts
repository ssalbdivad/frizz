 * alone until 2026-09-03, on the premise that "the files it exists for are the ones a worker just
 * edited in the checkout, so nothing under `~` needs to be readable here". That premise is false —
 * a worker's checkout is very often NOT the project directory. Over two weeks of this machine's
 * transcripts, 41% of every file a worker wrote sat outside every registered project dir: git
 * worktrees at `~/.cache/<tool>/worktrees/<slug>/`, sibling clones, `/tmp` scratch, the project's own
 * `attachments` state dir. Every one of those rail rows answered a click with "Local file is outside
 * Frizz's trusted roots" — while a `.md` in the SAME directory opened fine through the reader, which
 * had home-and-below all along (maintainer 2026-09-03: "why do we have this? I see it a lot, and it's
 * annoying").
 *
 * The narrower gate also bought no security it was the last line of. Frizz's exposed mode (`--host` /
 * `--public-origin`) has no auth at all, so anyone who can reach the origin can already dispatch a
 * worker that reads any file on the machine and prints it into a transcript — and `openLocalFile`
 * already spawns the desktop opener on anything under home. The origin check is the boundary; this is
 * defense in depth behind it, and it stays exactly as wide as the reader's.
 *
 * Binary is refused rather than rendered as noise: a NUL in the first 8 KiB is the classic tell and the
 * viewer is a text surface. Same 1 MiB line-boundary truncation as the Markdown reader.
