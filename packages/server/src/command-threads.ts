// TERMINAL COMMAND THREADS — the prompt box's Terminal tab. The human types `npm run dev`, and instead
// of dispatching an agent Frizz runs that command in a pty in the project directory and puts it on the
// board as its own row, whose drawer IS the live terminal.
//
// The pty rides the hardened /term/<slug> transport (terminal.ts), and is modelled on the sign-in
// terminal that transport was built for, for the same reason: ONE process per thread, a bounded replay so a
// tab that opens late (or reloads) sees the screen so far, and a subscriber set so two tabs watch the
// SAME process rather than each starting one.
//
// WHAT IS DURABLE AND WHAT IS NOT. The row — the command, when it ran, how its last run ended — lives in
// SQLite, so the board keeps it across a restart. The process does not: a pty is a child of this
// server, and replacing the control plane (Restart Frizz, an update) closes the pty master and hangs the
// process up. Boot records every run that never reported an exit as interrupted, so the rail says
// "interrupted" and offers Restart rather than showing a server that is not there.
//
// NOT an agent surface, and nothing here pretends to be one: no transcript and no wake. It DOES share
// the board's lifecycle: a finished run is waiting on the human exactly like a rested thread (`needsYou`),
// and it leaves the threads band the same way, by being marked done (`state: archived`). A run that is
// still going — `npm run dev` — never queues; it sits with the running threads until it ends.

// A dev server's log is long-lived and chatty; a late viewer needs the recent screen, not the banner.
// Trimmed from the FRONT, at a line boundary where one is near, so the replay starts on a clean line.
