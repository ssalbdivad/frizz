// THE QUESTION REGISTRY at the RPC boundary — the real router against real SQLite.
//
// `mcp__frizz__ask` registers a question the human owes an answer to, so that asking stops being a
// fenced block with the lifetime of the message carrying it (plans/rest-by-registration.md). The
// tailer recomputes `pendingQuestion` from the LATEST assistant text on every assistant record
// (`lastAssistantHasQuestion = hasQuestionBlock(raw)` — an assignment, not an OR) and clears it on any
// human turn, so a worker that asks and then says one more sentence has silently un-asked. A row does
// not do that, and these tests are about the ways a question could still go missing.
