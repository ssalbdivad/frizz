// TAKING A PROJECT APART — the two destructive halves of `projectRemove` that are not the registry.
//
// The registry half is one line (`forgetProject`) against a machine-level index file. These two are
// the ones with teeth: a project's WORKERS, which do not stop when its tenant does, and its STATE
// DIRECTORY, which holds every thread it has ever had.
//
// Both are called from index.ts, behind `AppContext.teardownProject`, and not from the router — which
// is what keeps this out of an import cycle with router.ts, whose `stopThreadRuntime` is the stop
// every one of these reduces to.

/**
 * Kill every live worker daemon in one project.
 *
 * A Frizz worker is a DETACHED daemon in its own process group — that is the whole point, and it is
 * why Ctrl-C on the server leaves a running turn alone. Deactivating a tenant therefore stops the
 * board, the tailer and the scheduler and touches no worker at all, which is exactly right for a
 * shutdown and exactly wrong for a delete: the daemon keeps running against a state directory that
 * is about to be unlinked, writes into files nobody can see, and can no longer be stopped from the UI
 * because the board it belonged to is gone.
 *
 * Per-row and forgiving, for the same reason `deleteExpiredDoneThreads` is (router.ts): a broker that will not answer for one
 * session must not strand the twenty after it. Returns how many were actually alive to stop, which is
 * what the operator is told.

 * Delete everything Frizz holds ON DISK for one project: `~/.frizz/projects/<id>/`.

 * ONE DIRECTORY IS THE FILES — attachments, logs, permission markers, the broker's and app-server's
 * sockets and records, and the pre-unification `ui.db` if the project predates the unified
 * database (left in place for an older build to find — see frizz-db.ts). The project's ROWS live in that database (frizz-db.ts) and are purged by the caller
 * through `purgeProject`, before this runs; the registry index is forgotten separately too.
 *
 * THE PROJECT'S OWN FOLDER IS NEVER TOUCHED. Deleting a project deletes Frizz's record of it, not the
 * operator's code; `.frizz/.id` is left in the tree, so adding the folder back keeps the same id and
 * simply starts a fresh board under it.
 *
 * The id is spliced into a path, so it is checked rather than trusted: a caller passing `..`, a slash,
 * or an empty string would otherwise aim `rm -rf` at the projects root, or at `~/.frizz` itself.
