// THE HOME WORKSPACE — where a prompt that belongs to no project runs.
//
// Some work has no project yet: cloning a repository, a question about the machine, a scratch script.
// Every thread needs a board to live on, and until this existed the only boards were registered project
// folders, so that work was filed under whichever project happened to be open. Home is the prompt box's
// other target: agents run in the operator's home folder (or the folder Settings → Home folder names),
// and its threads get a board of their own that behaves like any project's — its entry in Everything's
// project list, its lane in the queue, its square in the switcher.
//
// IT IS NOT A REGISTERED PROJECT, and cannot be one. A project's board is `<folder>/.frizz/`, and
// `~/.frizz` is not a free name: it is Frizz's own data root on every install that predates the XDG
// layout, and on every other install the mere EXISTENCE of that directory switches Frizz back to it on
// the next boot (frizz-paths.ts), taking every project's threads with it. The home folder is also the
// one directory project-root.ts refuses to adopt, for the same reason. So Home is synthesized here
// rather than written into registry.json, and its Project splits the two directories every registered
// project keeps as one:
//
//   · `workDir` — the home folder, where agents are spawned and resumed, where their transcripts are
//     sharded, and what their relative paths resolve against (project.ts workDirOf);
//   · `dir`     — its STATE DIRECTORY, which holds the board: `<state>/.frizz/threads/<session>/` is
//     where a Home thread's scratch directory lives, and a worker is handed that path absolute.
//
// Everything that reads `dir` meaning "the board" works unchanged, and a site that should have read
// workDirOf but did not puts an agent in Frizz's state directory — visibly wrong, never `~/.frizz`.
//
// It stays out of the registry's own lookups on purpose. The launcher reads listProjects to pick a
// project to host the server from (src/launcher.ts mostRecentProject), and hosting from Home would
// resolve its folder as a workspace — minting `.frizz/.id` in it. Only the SERVER's surfaces — the
// project list, routing, tenant priming — ask for workspaces.
