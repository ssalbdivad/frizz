// WHICH PROJECT A SPAWNED THREAD STARTS IN (2026-10-06).
//
// `spawn_thread` used to start the new thread in the CALLER's project, always, and the shim had no way to
// say otherwise. That is right for most spawns and wrong in exactly the case that matters: a standup
// digest running in Home spawned a fix for ArkType's docs, its prompt said "Repo: `~/arktype`", and the
// thread landed on Home's board — working in ArkType's checkout from a project that is not ArkType, out of
// sight of anyone looking at ArkType's queue (maintainer: "should have opened @star-fallback in arktype,
// not home").
//
// So the caller may NAME the project (`project`, matched here), and a spawn that names none is checked
// against its own prompt: a path inside ANOTHER open project's checkout is refused with the list of
// projects, so the worker has to choose rather than default. Passing `project` — even this project's own
// name — is the override, which keeps a prompt that merely mentions another repo dispatchable.
//
// Only paths count, never bare words: "arktype" in prose is a topic as often as a place, while
// `~/arktype/ark/docs` names where the work happens. And a path inside a project that CONTAINS the
// caller's (Home, for every repo under the home folder) is not evidence either — `~/.frizz/scratch` in a
// Frizz thread's brief is Home's folder, but the work is still Frizz's.
