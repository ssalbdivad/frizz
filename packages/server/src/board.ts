// for as long as it liked — "running", never at rest, so never queued (maintainer 2026-09-24: a thread
// "stuck in running after some 2fa call", clogging the board).

// It QUEUES the thread and leaves its runtime alone. `running` is what the composer reads to offer

// Fifteen minutes: well past the 60-second default a foreground Bash bounces at, past the ~5-minute test
// gate, and short enough that a turn blocked on a human is in front of one before they wonder where it
// went.
//
// A DELIBERATE LONG WAIT DOES NOT QUEUE. Colin's rule is that a thread listed as running never shows up
// in the queue (maintainer 2026-08-01: "if something is listed as currently running, then it should
// never show up in the queue"), and the Bash ceiling went to 24 hours precisely because "a blocking wait
// is DELIBERATE" (backend/types.ts BASH_MAX_TIMEOUT_MS): a call that names its own timeout was sized by a
// worker that knew what it was waiting for. Queuing that thread at minute fifteen turned every
// `nub run test` with `timeout: 1800000` into a card asking the human to interrupt it. So the silence is
// excused while either (deliberateWait):
//   - a tool call the turn is still blocked on declared an explicit timeout that has not run out yet
//     (the tailer's pendingToolCalls — Bash's `timeout`, any tool's `timeout_ms`), or
//   - the worker REGISTERED a wait (`mcp__frizz__watch`) on work that still resolves live, within the
//     row's own `for` (hasRegisteredBackgroundPark — the same predicate that parks a rest on it).
// Everything else still queues — a default-timeout Bash, an MCP call with no ceiling, a call whose
// declared timeout has passed — which is the 2FA wedge this exists for; the card's Snooze parks the rest.

// no watch descriptor is ever spent on those 715 directories and on fs-events the event never reaches

// whose only background work was a dev server nobody ever tore down: true by the letter, useless as a
// signal (maintainer 2026-08-14: "For it to be truly awaiting something, it needs to list it
// explicitly").
//
// THE FENCE REGISTERS NOTHING. It is display-only, and its whole job is to let a worker come to rest
// without being bumped for a handoff. A background shell already wakes its agent when it finishes — the
// harness reports the completion and the transcript carries a `wake` boundary for it, which is the
// hairline you see in chat — and a sub-agent's return re-invokes its parent. Frizz does not need to arm
// anything for either, and an earlier version of this that did was solving a problem that does not
// exist (maintainer 2026-08-14: "Any time a background shell completes, it should notify the agent…
// Both subagents and background shells should be display-only here").
//
// SO THE CHECK IS AN INTEGRITY CHECK, not a registration lookup: every item named must correspond to
// something this thread ACTUALLY has out right now — a running background shell, a running sub-agent, or
// a parked PR watcher (maintainer 2026-08-14: "Make sure that the items therein correspond to actual
// background shells or agents or watchers"). A name that matches nothing is not a park, and the thread
// queues exactly as it would have; a typo must never be a way to disappear from the board.
//
// A FIXED-PERIOD WAIT NEEDS NO SYNTAX EITHER. A worker that wants to wait ten minutes starts a
// background `sleep` and awaits that shell, which is the same mechanism with no new grammar.

  // not both claim it (maintainer 2026-08-01: "if something is listed as currently running, then it
  // should never show up in the queue"). That invariant is what `groups.inActiveBand` is written
  // against — it bands on `isActivelyRunning && !needsYou`, so this excusal is the ONLY thing that puts
  // a rested-with-live-work row in the Active band, and nothing can land there carrying a card.
  //
  // The reason it is a sub-agent excusal (maintainer 2026-07-30): queueing them made the rail row drop
  // out of the running band into the rested band and bounce straight back up when the child returned —
  // "there's too much layout shift as things jump between those two sections … it should only show up
  // in the queue when it's fully rested and it has no running sub-agents". It is bounded by
  // construction: a child whose completion signal is lost goes `stale` at the tailer's 15-min ceiling,
  // and only `running` holds here, so a child that never returns stops excusing its parent.
  //
  // A BACKGROUND SHELL DOES NOT EXCUSE, and the round trip is worth recording. Shells joined this
  // excusal on 2026-08-01 and left it again on 2026-08-04 (maintainer: "if a thread has rested and the
  // only thing remaining is background shells, we should put it into the queue"). The difference from a
  // sub-agent is the same one the rail already draws: a child returns and re-invokes its parent within
  // seconds, so the thread is genuinely mid-flight and there is nothing for the human to do; a shell is
  // DETACHED — 26% of real launches are servers that never exit, and there is no staleness clock — so a
  // thread resting behind one has finished its turn in every sense that matters to the operator, and
  // burying it in the running band means it is never seen again. It is a handoff, so it queues.
  //
  // The layout-shift worry that motivated the 2026-08-01 excusal is answered instead by the SNOOZE on
  // the card (see the branch below): one click parks it until the shell returns and the worker re-rests.
  // That is the human's call to make per thread, which an unconditional excusal took away from them.
  //
  // A DECLARED FENCE outranks the excusal (hence the `!tele?.lastFence` guard), because a fence is the
  // worker's own statement about why it stopped and it earns its own card: a ```done handoff still
  // cards as done, and a non-parked ```awaiting — a PR wait above all — stays a VISIBLE queue handoff
  // even with work out (maintainer 2026-07-24), so a PR watcher can never vanish merely because the
  // worker happens to have something running. Such a thread is NOT in the running band either

//
// SHELL-ONLY is why this went unnoticed at the time: the client's hasLiveOps then read raw sub-agents,
// so a snoozed thread with a live child kept its spinner in the running band and stayed legibly alive,
// while a snoozed shell-only one fell all the way through to a rested-band row with nothing behind it
