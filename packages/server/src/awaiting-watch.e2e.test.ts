// THE BACKGROUND-SHELL WAKE END TO END — real tailer folding a real transcript file, real scheduler,
// real SQLite, no fake telemetry anywhere.
//
// A SHELL IS WATCHED AUTOMATICALLY. Maintainer 2026-08-14: "the agent just uses the built-in tool from
// the harness to start a background shell. It should be watched automatically: every time a background
// shell completes, the agent should be woken up. That's how it should always work." So the wake owes
// nothing to the awaiting fence, and the FIRST test here is the one with no fence at all.
//
// This is the seam a unit test cannot reach, because the mechanism is a hand-off between two things that
// each look fine alone: the fold has to turn a background-shell launch into a live `bgShells` row and its
// `<task-notification>` into a RETIREMENT carrying a finish INSTANT, and the scheduler has to compare
// that instant against the agent's own last word. A mock at either joint proves nothing about the other
// — which is how a version of this shipped a watcher that could never fire (`bf14128`), and how the
// `watch:` hint shipped unparseable (`9b6322e`).
//
// The transcript records are shape-accurate against a real ~/.claude/projects session (2026-07-23):
// the launch is a `tool_result` whose text carries "Command running in background with ID: <taskId>"
// with `toolUseResult.backgroundTaskId`, and the retirement is a `queue-operation` record whose
// `content` is the `<task-notification>` XML.
