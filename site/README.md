# frizz.sh

The site at [frizz.sh](https://frizz.sh): a landing page and the docs, built with [Fumadocs](https://fumadocs.dev) on
Next.js — the same stack and shape as [zod.dev](https://zod.dev) and the `yes` docs.

It is its own app, not a member of the repo's pnpm workspace, so it installs and builds on its own:

```sh
cd site
pnpm install --ignore-workspace
pnpm dev        # http://localhost:4100
pnpm build
```

| Path | What it is |
| --- | --- |
| `app/(home)/page.tsx` | The landing page. |
| `content/docs/` | The docs, one MDX file per page. `meta.json` orders the sidebar and names its sections. |
| `app/docs/` | The docs layout and page route. |
| `app/global.css` | The board's palette (`packages/web/src/styles.css`) as Fumadocs tokens, dark by default, and a warm light theme. |
| `components/mark.tsx` | The cursive `fff` mark, drawn as one stroke on load. Its path is `components/mark-path.ts`, from `assets/logo-concepts/final/fff.svg`. |
| `public/img/` | Screenshots captured from a sandboxed `scripts/adhoc-stack.mjs` instance (seeded threads, no real data). The `README.md` at the repo root uses copies in `assets/`; re-shoot both together. |
| `og/` | Source for `public/img/og.png`, the 1200×630 social card. Not deployed. |

The remote-access guides (`content/docs/remote-access.mdx`, `frizz-sh.mdx`, `cloudflare-tunnel.mdx`, `tailscale.mdx`,
`ssh.mdx`, `reverse-proxy.mdx`) mirror [`docs/remote-access.md`](../docs/remote-access.md). Change one and change the
other.

## Why `/docs` and not `docs.frizz.sh`

The relay Worker owns `*.frizz.sh/*`, and a workers route beats a custom domain — a subdomain here is
answered by the relay with *No Frizz board has claimed this name*, which is exactly how `registrar.frizz.sh`
went down the day the relay shipped. A path on the apex is not covered by that wildcard. A subdomain would
work only with its own more-specific route, the way the registrar has one.

## Deploying

The Vercel project is `frizz` under the `colinhacks-projects` scope, deployed from this directory with the CLI:

```sh
vercel --cwd site --prod
```

Vercel builds it as a Next.js app: `vercel.json` sets the framework, which was "Other" while the site was static
HTML.

## Regenerating the social card

```sh
python3 -m http.server 8765 --directory site   # in one shell
nub scripts/shot.mjs http://127.0.0.1:8765/og/og.html site/public/img/og.png "" --w=1200 --h=630 --dsf=1 --wait=1500
```
