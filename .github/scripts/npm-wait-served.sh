# A direct publish is not the end of it: npm holds a new version in automated review, and the
# version does not exist on the registry until that finishes — 6m 40s for frizz 0.13.5
# (2026-09-14); pullfrog measured 3.5, ~54 and 236 minutes. None of those is an upper bound, so
# release.yml sets the deadline as late as its six-hour job cap allows, and an expiry here means
# something is wrong, not merely slow.
#
# It reads the registry URL directly rather than through `npm view`, which revalidates a cached
# packument and can report a live version as missing for minutes (pullfrog, diagnosing its 0.1.66
# and 0.1.72 releases).
