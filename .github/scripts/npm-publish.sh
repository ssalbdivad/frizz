# Publish one package directory to npm: `npm publish` through OIDC trusted publishing, which
# attaches provenance on its own.
#
# Until 2026-09-30 this was npm-stage-publish.sh and ran `npm stage publish`, so every version
# waited for a maintainer's 2FA approval. release.yml's header says why that was dropped.
#
# Idempotent, because a run that dies after the publish is finished by re-running it. A version the
# registry already serves is skipped. A version npm has accepted but still holds in its automated
# review is not served yet, so a re-run publishes it again and npm refuses — pullfrog saw `E409
# Cannot publish over previously staged version` on exactly that re-run — and that refusal is
# success here: npm-wait-served.sh, which follows every publish in release.yml, still gates on the
# registry actually serving the version. The wording is matched loosely; anything else stays fatal.
#
# E403 is checked FIRST, is always fatal, and names the fix. `E403 OIDC permission denied for this
# action` is what npm returns when the trusted publisher's allowed actions do not include a direct
# `npm publish` — which is exactly the state a stage-only publisher left from 2026-09-22 is in.
