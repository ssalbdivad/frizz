// The ONE node-side client for frizz's RPC surface. Every harness and verify script must use this
// instead of hand-rolling `fetch`.
//
// Two pieces of knowledge live here and nowhere else, because getting either wrong produces a
// PLAUSIBLE-LOOKING WRONG ANSWER rather than an error — which is exactly how a harness ends up
// "proving" something it never tested:
//
//   1. TRANSPORT SPLIT. A `query` is GET with the input JSON-encoded into `?input=`; a `mutation` is
//      POST with a JSON body. POSTing a query does not throw — it 404s, and a harness that only
//      checks `status === 200` on the happy path reads the miss as "no data".
//   2. ENVELOPE. Every response is `{ result }` or `{ error }` — never the payload bare. Reading
//      `body.slug` off the envelope yields `undefined` for a call that actually SUCCEEDED.
//
// Both were gotten wrong at once while verifying the codex daemon fix (2026-07-23): the harness
// reported FAIL on a dispatch that had in fact worked. The app's browser client has always known
// this (packages/web/src/api) — the node side just had no shared copy to import.
//
// Loopback `Origin` is required or the server 403s a cross-origin write.
//
//   3. THE `/_frizz` PREFIX (c34a7e2). Everything frizz serves lives under it, and every other
//      top-level path is a project slug that falls through to the SPA shell — with a 200 and an HTML
//      body. So an unprefixed `/rpc/board` does not 404 either: it reads back as "rpc board failed
//      (200): <!doctype html>", and an unprefixed `/health` probe resolves TRUE against the shell
//      before the server is anywhere near ready. Build every URL through FRIZZ_ROUTE_PREFIX.
