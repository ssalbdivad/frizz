// Headless Chrome has no pointing device, so it answers `(hover: none)` and `(pointer: none)`: every
// headless shot is a TOUCH screen. That matters twice over here. Tailwind v4 gates every `hover:` / `group-hover:` style on
// `(hover: hover)`, so parking the pointer with page.hover() fires the events and paints none of the hover
// styles — a "hover" shot of a pill came back identical to its resting state (2026-09-28). And this app's
// touch rules key on `(hover: none)` (ProjectList's row actions, the code-block copy button), so a desktop
// shot shows controls a desktop hides until hover.
//
// These Blink settings make the page a desktop with a mouse: hover-capable, fine pointer (Blink's
// HoverType HOVER = 2, PointerType FINE = 4). Launch-time only — a browser you CONNECT to keeps its own.
