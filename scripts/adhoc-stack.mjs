// Disposable, fully-ISOLATED frizz stack for ad hoc CDP / manual verification.
//
// Why this exists: verifying a frizz change means driving the REAL app end-to-end, but you must never
// touch the maintainer's live instance or real ~/.frizz SQLite. This boots a
// throwaway stack that is sandboxed on every axis:
//   • HOME              → a fresh temp dir, so the SQLite DB + server.lock live in an empty ~/.frizz
//   • PORT              → a unique high port, so it never fights the dev server on 5175
//   • FRIZZ_WAKERS_OFF=1 → scheduler OFF by default (no wake side effects); pass --wakers to arm it
// The project defaults to the frizz repo itself (a gh-authed repo, an empty board under the temp HOME).
//
// Usage:
//   nub scripts/adhoc-stack.mjs [--port=4930] [--project=/abs/dir] [--claude-bin=/abs/bin] [--wakers] [--reaper] [--prime] [--keep] [--home=/abs] [--seed]
//
// It prints ONE json line to stdout: {"url","port","home","project"} once /health is green,
// then stays up until SIGINT/SIGTERM, deleting the temp HOME on exit (unless --keep). Run it with Bash
// run_in_background:true, parse that json line, then drive the url with Chrome DevTools MCP or shot.mjs.
