// THE BROWSER E2E SUITE — `nub run test:e2e`. Boots a vite over `packages/web`, points every
// `*.e2e.test.ts` at it, runs them ONE AT A TIME, and tears the server back down.
//
// It exists because the suite had rotted in place with nothing on screen to say so. Each of these
// files gates itself on its OWN env var (`skip: !process.env.FRIZZ_<SOMETHING>_E2E_URL`), and NOTHING
// in the repo has ever set one — not `run-tests.mjs`, not CI. The files match the `packages/web/src/**
// /*.test.ts` glob, so they were IN the default run the whole time, reporting `skipped` and counting
// as green. Twenty-eight browser tests can go stale for months that way, and two of them had
// (2026-08-24). A skip nobody chose is a test nobody has.
//
// The env var is still per-file and still the gate. That is deliberate — it is what lets you run one
// file by hand against a vite you already have open, which is how these are actually debugged, and the
// header of each file documents its own variable. This script just sets all of them at once.
//
// ONE BROWSER AT A TIME, which is the other half of the reason this exists. Node's runner defaults to
// `os.availableParallelism() - 1` files in flight, so an unpinned run over this glob launches ~9 real
// Chromes at once. That is not a hypothetical: on 2026-08-19 two concurrent runs of a single file
// wedged the machine badly enough that `browser.close()` took 40s-2min to return, every test blew its
// timeout, and the suite read as uniformly broken when nothing was wrong with it. Each of these files
// owns a real browser and several are geometry assertions; they are I/O-bound on a shared GPU and a
// shared window server, not on cores. `--test-concurrency=1` costs wall-clock and buys a run whose
// failures mean something.
//
//   nub run test:e2e                     the whole browser suite
//   nub run test:e2e -- --url=http://…   against a vite you already have running
//   nub run test:e2e -- <file> <file>    just these, still serial, still against a fresh vite
//
// NOT EVERY e2e FILE IS HERE. `lib/projectSwitch.e2e.test.ts` needs a real multi-project Frizz rather
// than a plain vite over the fixtures — see its own header for the `adhoc-stack.mjs` invocation. It is
// excluded by name below rather than silently missing, so the exclusion is a decision you can find.

// Listed by name, and then CROSS-CHECKED against the structural tell below, because either half alone
// rots: a bare list silently stops matching when a file is renamed, and a bare heuristic silently
// reclassifies a file when someone adds an unrelated fixture URL to it. Disagreement is an error, not
// a guess — this script exists because a silently-not-run test is indistinguishable from a passing one.
