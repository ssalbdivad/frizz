/**
 * The whole product, against the LIVE registrar and the LIVE relay.
 *
 * Every other harness here stands something in for the internet — workerd on loopback, a supervisor
 * with an invented public origin, a toy board that accepts any upgrade. This one has no stand-ins. It
 * claims a name from the registrar that is actually deployed, serves a real board through the relay
 * that is actually deployed, and reaches it the way a phone does: over the public internet, by
 * hostname, through Cloudflare.
 *
 * WHAT IT COSTS: a 30-day lease on the name. The seeded config is a relay claim, so the launch RENEWS
 * it with the owning key alone — no GitHub sign-in, nothing new consumed. The name must therefore be
 * held by that key already; a custom name nobody holds yet is claimed once through the R pane, which
 * asks for a GitHub device-flow sign-in this harness cannot answer.
 *
 * Three things it has to do that a naive harness gets wrong, each of which cost a run:
 *
 *   A PTY, NOT A PIPE. The board's readout is a terminal UI, and `script` cannot stand in for one —
 *   it wants a terminal on its own stdin and dies with tcgetattr/ioctl.
 *
 *   A SAVED CONFIG rather than the R walkthrough. Remote access is set up interactively now, and the
 *   walkthrough's cursor starts on whichever choice is CURRENT — so blind key-sending picks a
 *   different option depending on prior state. Seeding `~/.frizz/cloud.json` is what the walkthrough
 *   writes, and it exercises the path every launch after the first one takes, which is the path that
 *   actually has to keep working.
 *
 *   A GIT REPOSITORY as the project. Frizz refuses a bare directory, which is why --sandbox mints a
 *   throwaway repo rather than a throwaway folder.
 *
 *   THE OWNING IDENTITY, seeded into the sandbox home. A name belongs to the key that claimed it, so a
 *   fresh key is correctly refused with "that name is already taken" — verified below, because that
 *   refusal is the whole ownership model.
 *
 * KNOWN FLAKE, 2026-08-26, and it is NOT this harness: a board with a saved setup sometimes comes up
 * loopback-only. When it does, `serveSaved()` neither throws nor acts — nothing is printed, and the
 * cloud.json is still on disk and still correct afterwards (this harness checks both on failure). That
 * points at the `home` the remote controller resolves in the launched process rather than at the config.
 * Re-run; when the setup takes, every check below passes.
