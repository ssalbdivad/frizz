// OPTICAL WEIGHT OF THE SIDEBAR RAIL'S STATUS GLYPHS (and a printed centring reading beside it).
//
// The rail is a checkbox family: every thread state is the SAME rounded-rect box (StatusBox, 15px) with
// a different mark inside. Four such marks already shipped — the ellipsis, the check, the "?" and the
// "!" — and 2026-08-01 added a fifth, the pulsing blue dot for "at rest, but work it launched is still
// running". (A sixth — a coloured mark for a standing/scheduled wake — shipped and was pulled the same
// day, 2026-08-02: the rail is read for what a thread is DOING, and a thread that will be re-prompted the
// moment it stops is simply WORKING. This script measured it while it existed and it was both the widest
// and half again the heaviest mark in the column, which is worth remembering if the slot is ever refilled.)
// A dot is the one mark that can
// silently wreck that column: a SOLID disc is far heavier per unit of diameter than an outlined glyph, so
// a dot sized to look right in isolation reads as the loudest thing in the rail.
// `.md-task-in-progress` measured exactly this for the same box (0.4 of the
// box → 12.65% ink against the check's 5.81%; 0.31 → ~7.5%, inside the family), and this script is what
// holds the rail itself to that finding instead of trusting an eyeball.
//
// It has to be a PIXEL measurement. `getBoundingClientRect` returns the same numbers whether a mark is
// centred or hard against a wall, and it is blind to everything painted outside the geometry — the
// box-shadow halo the transcript's dot carries is a THIRD of that mark's painted width and no DOM
// reading mentions it (scripts/ink-pixels.mjs exists for the same reason).
//
// Method, borrowed from verify-md-task-glyph-centering.mjs: hide the box's border so only the inner
// mark paints, screenshot each box at a high deviceScaleFactor, and take the ink bbox + inked-pixel
// count of what is left. The border is symmetric, so the border box's centre IS the interior's.
//
// The rail's glyphs are pinned in px (lucide at 10/15, a 15px box), so unlike the md-task family they
// cannot be measured at a blown-up size — hence a high DSF instead, where one CSS pixel is 8 device
// pixels and the coverage ratio is not quantisation noise. The `__calibration__` row is centred by
// CONSTRUCTION at the same size: if IT does not measure centred, the instrument is off at this scale
// and the run fails rather than quietly subtracting a bogus offset.
//

// THE MARK UNDER TEST. The gate is deliberately RELATIVE — "the dot must not become the heaviest or the
// lightest thing in the column" — rather than an absolute coverage band, for two reasons. The rail's
// pre-existing marks already span 2.4× (the hourglass is a dense multi-stroke glyph; the "!" is one
// stroke), so an absolute band would either fail states this change never touched or be so wide it
// asserts nothing. And the actual design question for a NEW mark is exactly the relative one: a solid
// disc is far heavier per unit of diameter than an outlined glyph, so a dot sized by eye lands outside
// the family it has to join. MEASURED, as the control for this gate: the transcript's own 6px dot with
// its halo — 0.4 of the box — covered 22.53%, against an existing ceiling of 9.42% and level with the
// entire spinner outline at 22.96%. It was the loudest thing in the rail. 0.31 with no halo puts it at
// 9.00%, just under the hourglass.
const UNDER_TEST = "background"
// THE HALF-PIXEL TRAP, measured 2026-08-02 and the reason the rail's coloured glyph looked off-centre. StatusBox
// is 15px with a 1px border and border-box sizing, so its CONTENT is 13px — an ODD number. Centring an
// EVEN-sized glyph in it leaves 1.5px a side, the glyph starts on a half pixel, and the rasteriser pushes
// its ink half a pixel right and down. That is not noise: on a 15px mark it is the whole complaint the
// maintainer raised ("the heartbeat icon is not optically centered", of that since-removed mark), and no geometry reading shows it —
// getBoundingClientRect on the SVG's paths reports a dead-centred mark either way. An odd size lands on
// the grid and measures centred, which is why every mark here is 9 or 11 and none is 10.
// EXEMPT: `done`/`archived` wear the Check at 10 and have shipped that way for months, carrying the same
// 0.5px offset. It is a real instance of this bug on a mark nobody has complained about, and resizing a
// shipped glyph is a design change, not a fix — so it is named here rather than silently corrected.
