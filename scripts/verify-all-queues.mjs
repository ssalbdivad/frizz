// Drive the page's ALL PROJECTS view (`/?all`, web lib/pageView.ts — "Everything", at `/`, until focus
// mode made one project the default on 2026-09-29) in a real headless browser against a seeded
// multi-project stack, and check that every action taken on a card lands on the card's OWN project — and
// that the view works as a MODE: threads open in place, and new ones start in any project from it.
//
// Its one hard problem: All projects shows every project but is BOUND to one (the page project — the
// prompt box's pick), so the page-level client (`rpc`) means that project there, and a slug is unique only
// within a project — an action wired to the wrong client either fails against the page's project or,
// worse, succeeds on its namesake. So the page is bound to the launcher (reached the way a person reaches
// it: the launcher's own `/?project=` landing, then the switcher's All projects, which carries the project
// over as the pick), every write is taken on a TENANT's card (where the page client would be wrong), and
// the same-slug pair the seed plants (`fix-flaky-login-test`, in the launcher AND a tenant) is checked from
// both sides — from the cards, and from a tenant's drawer opened in place.
//
// Usage: node scripts/verify-all-queues.mjs --stack=/abs/stack.log [--shots=/abs/dir]
//   against a stack booted by adhoc-stack.mjs (with --also-project for marketing-site, billing-worker and

//   undo all of it (snoozes and completions outlive the seed's rows): run it on a freshly booted stack.
//   Exits non-zero when any check fails.
