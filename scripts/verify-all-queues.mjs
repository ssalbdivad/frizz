// Drive the cross-project page ("Everything", `/`) in a real headless browser against a seeded
// multi-project stack, and check that every action taken on a card lands on the card's OWN project — and
// that the page works as a MODE: threads open in place, and new ones start in any project from it.
//
// Its one hard problem: the page shows every project but is FOCUSED on one (the page project), so the
// page-level client (`rpc`) means the focus there, and a slug is unique only within a project — an action
// wired to the wrong client either fails against the focus or, worse, succeeds on the focus's namesake.
// So the page is focused on the launcher, every write is taken on a TENANT's card (where the page client
// would be wrong), and the same-slug pair the seed plants (`fix-flaky-login-test`, in the launcher AND a
// tenant) is checked from both sides — from the cards, and from a tenant's drawer opened in place.
//
// Usage: node scripts/verify-all-queues.mjs --stack=/abs/stack.log [--shots=/abs/dir]
//   against a stack booted by adhoc-stack.mjs (with --also-project for marketing-site, billing-worker and
//   docs-portal) and seeded by scripts/seed-all-queues.mjs. It MUTATES that state, and a reseed does not
//   undo all of it (snoozes and completions outlive the seed's rows): run it on a freshly booted stack.
//   Exits non-zero when any check fails.
