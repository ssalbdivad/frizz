#!/usr/bin/env node
// The project test suite — `nub run test`. Runs node's test runner exactly as before, then proves
// the run was COMPLETE before it lets the run be green.
//
// The problem it exists for: `--test-force-exit` makes each per-file child process.exit() the moment
// its tests finish, and that discards whatever is still queued on the async pipe carrying its
// verdicts to the parent. The parent counts only what arrived and still prints `fail 0` /
// `cancelled 0` and exits 0. Measured 2026-08-16: one run in four dropped the last 31 of
// delivery-ledger.test.ts's 70 tests, with nothing on screen to say so. Upstream: nodejs/node#64833.
//
// Dropping the flag is not the fix — packages/server/src/backend/claude-agent-broker.test.ts leaks a
// handle and hangs forever without it (measured: still running after 90s, `cancelled 1`). So the
// flag stays, scripts/test-guard-preload.mjs stops the truncation at its source, and this script
// reconciles what each child EMITTED against what the parent RECEIVED. Any shortfall is a hard
// failure with the offending files named.
//
//   nub run test                       the whole suite
//   nub run test packages/x/y.test.ts  just these files, same guard
