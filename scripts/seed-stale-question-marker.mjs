// NOTE 2026-09-28: a marker no longer PLACES anything — a card renders at the BOTTOM of the rest it
// belongs to and never inside a message (maintainer: "questions should always appear at the bottom of the
// thread not in the middle any explanation should occur beforehand"), and only the HUMAN'S turn ends that
// rest, not a frizz wake. So, per variant:
//   (default)       the marker's own slot draws NOTHING; the card sits under the WHOLE asking handoff
//                   ("Both PRs have watchers armed…" above it), still above the human's reply.
//   --fresh-marker  the marker in the final handoff carries the card to the BOTTOM of that handoff —
//                   under "The Mini autocomplete question is still open…", not in the marker's slot.
//   --woken         no marker at all, and the human's reply is replaced by a frizz WAKE (a PR watcher
//                   expiring): nobody but frizz has spoken, so the card rides down under the final handoff.
// NOTE 2026-09-24: the expectation below is REVERSED. An open question now stays at the rest that asked
// it (lib/questionAnchor), so the card belongs ABOVE the human's reply, not at the tail; a marker in the
// older handoff keeps placing there, with its Send right after that rest.
// Seed a disposable adhoc stack with ONE simulated worker in the shape that made a rest read as a bare
// stop: the worker registered a question and wrote its ```question qst_… PLACEMENT MARKER into that
// handoff, the human replied past it without answering, and the worker worked on and rested AGAIN with
// the question still open and no marker in the new handoff.
//
// The card used to stay pinned at the OLD rest — thousands of pixels up — while the tail drew the
// group's bare disabled "Send answers" with nothing above it to answer, so the newest handoff read as a
// rest with no sign-off at all (maintainer 2026-09-13: "How did this thread pause without a sign-off?",
// which is the 2026-08-31 report arriving again through the marker). The anchor path's at-rest
// re-anchor could never reach it: a PLACED question is subtracted before that path runs.
//
// Pass --fresh-marker to write the marker into the FINAL handoff instead. That is the control: the same
// code path must place the card INSIDE that message rather than at the tail, so a run that draws the
// card at the tail either way proves nothing.
//
// Follows the frizz-stack recipe: a session row + a JSONL the REAL tailer reads. No process.
