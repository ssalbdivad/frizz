// NOTE 2026-09-24: the expectation below is REVERSED. An open question now stays at the rest that asked
// it (lib/questionAnchor), so the card belongs ABOVE the human's reply, not at the tail; a marker in the
// older handoff keeps placing there, with its Send right after that rest.
// Seed an adhoc stack with the shape that decides WHERE an open REGISTERED question renders once the
// human has replied past it and the worker has rested again (maintainer 2026-08-31, on
// `evaluate-critically-never-assume`: "Why was this able to come to rest without a proper handoff?").
//
//   • q-current-rest — the worker registers a question and rests; the human replies WITHOUT answering
//                      it; the worker answers the follow-up and RESTS AGAIN with the row still open.
//                      Anchored to the asking rest, the card strands above the human's own reply and
//                      the newest handoff — the one they are reading — shows no ask at all, so the rest
//                      reads as a bare stop. It belongs at the CURRENT rest, under the final message.
//   • q-fresh-ask    — the control: asked at the newest rest with nothing since. This one already
//                      rendered at the tail and must not move.
//
// Follows the frizz-stack recipe: a session row + a JSONL the REAL tailer reads. The `thread_question`
// row is the same kind of fixture as the session row — there is no human-facing RPC that registers a
// question (only a worker's `ask` MCP tool does), so the row IS the fixture and everything downstream
// of it — board projection, push, render — runs for real.
