// Fails when the frizz.sh Workers run anything that `.github/workflows/workers-deploy.yml` did not
// upload. `.github/workflows/workers-drift.yml` runs it every 30 minutes, and a failed scheduled run
// is the alarm: GitHub emails it.
//
// WHY IT EXISTS. From 2026-09-21 to 2026-10-08 an attacker holding a Cloudflare API token replaced
// both Workers with backdoored builds of our own source, and nothing noticed for seventeen days. The
// Workers now deploy from CI only, so every upload that did not come from CI is by definition wrong,
// and this is the check that says so.
//
// WHAT COUNTS AS CI. Each check below is one an attacker holding a Cloudflare deploy token must pass:
//
// - The message. CI deploys with `--message "ci:<sha> run:<run id>"`, which wrangler stamps on the
//   version AND the deployment. Anyone with a token can type that, so on its own it proves nothing;
//   what it buys is the run id for the next check.
// - The run. The named run must exist in THIS repository, be a `workflow_dispatch` of
//   workers-deploy.yml on main at the named sha, and the upload must have happened while that run was
//   live. A Cloudflare token cannot create a GitHub run, and an old run's window has closed, so a
//   replayed message lands outside it. This is the check that holds.
// - The author. Every version records who uploaded it. CI uploads with an account-owned token that
//   nothing else holds, so its author differs from any laptop's; `WORKERS_CI_AUTHOR` (a repository
//   variable) names it. Unset, the check fails and prints the authors it saw, so the first CI deploy
//   tells you the value.
// - The source. `metadata.source` must be `wrangler`. Weak — an attacker uses wrangler too — but a
//   dashboard edit or a raw API upload fails it for free.
//
// WHAT IT READS. The ACTIVE deployment always (the newest; it serves 100% of traffic unless a split
// names two versions, and then both are checked), plus every deployment and every version created in
// the last LOOKBACK. The lookback is what catches an attacker who deploys and rolls back between two
// runs, and an upload that was never deployed. It is wider than the schedule because GitHub delays
// and drops scheduled runs under load.
//
// A legitimate `wrangler secret put` or dashboard edit fails this too: each one creates a version and
// a deployment that CI did not make, and nothing here can tell the maintainer from an attacker. That
// is the point. Re-run the deploy workflow afterwards; the alarm clears once the CI deployment is
// active and the stray one has aged out of the lookback.
//
// Anything it cannot read — a missing or revoked token, a Cloudflare or GitHub error — also fails the
// run. A check that cannot see must not go green.
