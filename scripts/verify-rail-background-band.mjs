// END-TO-END: does a worker that REST S with a live background shell actually reach the rail as a
// running-band row wearing the pulsing dot?
//
// The fixture pages set `awaitingBackground` by hand, which proves the CLIENT renders a flag — not that
// the flag ever gets set. The seam this closes is the whole chain: a real Bash launch with
// `run_in_background: true` in a real transcript → the REAL tailer's bgShellViews → the REAL
// board.deriveAwaitingBackground / deriveNeedsYou → the pushed snapshot → groups.ts banding → the glyph.
// Every link there is a place the change could be right in isolation and wrong in the app.
//
// It simulates the worker rather than dispatching a live provider (the sandbox HOME hides the keychain,
// so a real `claude` cannot authenticate) — but everything DOWNSTREAM of the transcript is the shipped
// code path, which is exactly the part under test.
//
// "The rail" is now the project list's rows on the one page (ProjectList.tsx): a project's Ready rows,
// each tied to its queue card, then its Working rows. Until 2026-09-28 it was the project board's
// sidebar, whose running and rested bands a rule split; the question is the same one, asked of the rows
// the page draws now.
//
// Usage (run from the stack's launching project dir — the fixture's transcript is keyed by the cwd):
