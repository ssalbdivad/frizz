/**
 * frizz-mcp — THE frizz MCP server: one unified, dependency-free MCP stdio server (mounted as `frizz`,
 * so its tools are `mcp__frizz__<tool>`) carrying every capability frizz hands its own WORKERS:
 *
 *   spawn_thread     — dispatch a brand-new TOP-LEVEL frizz board thread (its own session + scratchpad +
 *                      independent drive — NOT an in-session Agent/Task helper).
 *   goal — arm ONE piece of text frizz re-sends the caller, at every rest and/or on a clock
 *                      and/or after every compaction; and READ BACK what is currently armed.
 *   timer            — arm a ONE-OFF prompt for a single instant; a thread may hold many at once.
 *
 * Future worker-facing frizz tools join the TOOLS registry below rather than mounting a second server:
 * one server keeps the worker's tool namespace coherent and the server-level pre-approval single.
 *
 * spawn_thread wraps frizz's own dispatch RPC: it reads the running server's port from a server.lock
 * and POSTs `/_frizz/<project>/rpc/dispatch`. That surface has no token auth — only a loopback-origin
 * CSRF gate — so a headerless local POST with `sec-fetch-site: same-origin` (undici sends no Origin)
 * satisfies it.
 *
 * Mounted by the server (dispatch.ts) into the Claude backend via `--mcp-config`, and into codex via
 * `-c mcp_servers.frizz` (codex-mcp.ts). Both hand this process the same env, built once in
 * frizzMcpEnv: FRIZZ_SERVER_LOCK, FRIZZ_PROJECT_ID and FRIZZ_STATE_DIR.
 *
 * BUT NOTHING HERE DEPENDS ON THAT ENV STAYING TRUE. This process lives inside a DETACHED worker
 * daemon that outlives frizz restart after restart, so anything frozen into it at spawn is a bug
 * waiting for the next "Update & Restart" to move the port. Both facts we need are therefore resolved
 * PER CALL, from files: the server's address (serverLockPort — the env hint, then the machine-wide
 * `<frizz root>/server.lock`, then any live project lock, skipping any whose pid is gone) and our own
 * project (projectSegment — the stamp, else `.frizz/.id` walked up from our cwd). The env is a hint
 * that saves a lookup; the filesystem is the truth.
 *
 * Protocol: MCP over stdio = newline-delimited JSON-RPC 2.0. We implement exactly the four methods a
 * client drives (initialize, tools/list, tools/call, ping) plus the initialized notification. Hand-
 * rolled rather than pulling @modelcontextprotocol/sdk: the surface is tiny, it ships as one loose
 * .mjs next to bin/frizz (no build/bundle/resolution concerns), and it matches this repo's own
 * hand-rolled-RPC aesthetic. The server NEVER crashes on a bad tool call: failures come back as an
 * isError tool result so the worker sees a message instead of a dead tool.

/**
 * FIND THE RUNNING FRIZZ — every call, never cached, never frozen at spawn.
 *
 * This process is spawned once, inside a DETACHED worker daemon that outlives restart after restart.
 * An address handed to it in its env is therefore true exactly until the next "Update & Restart", and
 * a worker whose only address was stale simply lost every frizz tool it had — with no way back short of
 * restarting the worker itself, which is not what an update button should mean.
 *
 * So the env is a HINT and the file is the truth, in this order:
 *   1. FRIZZ_SERVER_LOCK  — the lock this server published when it spawned us. Right almost always.
 *   2. `<frizz root>/server.lock` — the MACHINE address (frizz-paths.ts `serverAddressPath`), rewritten
 *      by every boot whatever project launched it. This is what makes a live worker survive an update.
 *   3. `<state dir>/server.lock` — our own project's, for a server that only ever serves one project.
 *   4. any live `<frizz root>/projects/*​/server.lock` — last resort, since one machine runs one frizz.
 *
 * A candidate whose PID IS DEAD IS SKIPPED, which is the difference between a legible failure and the
 * one that cost an afternoon: a stale lock from a long-dead per-project server sent every call at a port
 * nothing was listening on, and the tool reported only "fetch failed".
 *
 * The frizz root is `../..` from the state dir rather than computed: this file is dependency-free and
