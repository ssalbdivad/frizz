// @ts-check
// SCRATCH-DIRECTORY hook (frizz-worker) — keeps a worker aware of the per-thread scratch directory
// (`.frizz/threads/<sid>/`) it may use, and re-orients it on that directory when its context is lost.
// Run directly with node (zero deps, max Node compat), mirroring the other hooks in this plugin.
//
// WHAT THIS USED TO BE, AND WHY IT IS NOT ANY MORE. Until 2026-08-06 frizz provisioned ONE canonical
// `scratch.md` per thread and this hook spliced its HEAD into the context window after every compaction,
// on the argument that a bare "remember to read your scratchpad" routes recovery through a decision the
// model can skip. That argument was sound and the mechanism still lost: it made a maintained file the
// price of admission for every worker, it needed a merge-only contract per backend to keep sub-agents
// from clobbering it, and the injection was invisible to the operator, who could neither see nor change
// what their worker would be told.
//
// The maintainer's replacement (chosen deliberately over keeping a canonical doc): the thread gets a
// free-form scratch DIRECTORY, and compaction recovery moves to `mcp__frizz__goal`'s
// post_compaction trigger — the worker writes whatever doc it likes and LINKS it in a prompt frizz
// re-sends when the context is summarized away. Durable in SQLite, visible in the thread footer,
// editable by the human. This hook's job is therefore reduced to two honest things:
//
//   1. TELL the worker the directory exists, and that the arming is what makes anything in it come back.
//   2. On compact/resume, say what is IN the directory — a listing, not the content. That is the
//      degradation the maintainer accepted when choosing this over a canonical doc, and it is stated
//      here rather than quietly re-implemented as an injection: a worker that never armed the trigger
//      gets a pointer it may skip. Naming the files it already wrote is the most a pointer can do.
//
// CODEX CHILD EPILOGUE — native Codex sub-agents inherit the root conversation's system/user
// instructions even with `fork_turns:"none"`. The `subagent-start` mode is what tells such a child to
// write its OWN file rather than treating a document it did not create as its own. It also carries the
// codex half of the default-off nesting rule (2026-08-04): a native child does the work itself and does
// not `spawn_agent` a layer of its own unless its task said to. SubagentStart is the only structural
// seam that reaches a native child, the way agent-dispatch.mjs's epilogue is for Claude.
//
// THE WRITE-SIDE NUDGE — two channels:
//   UserPromptSubmit — the turn boundary.
//   PostToolUse      — MID-TURN, and this is the one that matters. A frizz worker runs enormous
//                      autonomous turns (dozens of tool calls between human prompts), so a
//                      turn-boundary-only nudge can miss an entire session's worth of work. PostToolUse
//                      additionalContext was verified live against cli 2.1.220: a real session quoted a
//                      sentinel injected after a Bash call. Both channels share one state file, so the
//                      interval is global — firing per tool call does NOT multiply the nudges.
//
// NO HOOK FIRES ON CONTEXT PRESSURE — measured, not assumed. Claude Code 2.1.220 exposes 31 hook
// events and not one of them signals an approaching context limit; no hook input carries a token
// count at all (the docs say plainly: poll the transcript yourself). So this computes the fill
// itself from the transcript's newest usage record — `input + cache_creation + cache_read` is the
// live context size — reading only the file's TAIL, since transcripts reach tens of megabytes.
//
// STALENESS IS GROWTH SINCE THE LAST WRITE, never an absolute threshold: the window size is not
// knowable from a hook (a real compaction in this project fired at preTokens 935,291 on a 1M-window
// session, while a 200k session compacts near 160k). Growth is window-independent and self-resetting.
//
// NOT A BLOCKING GATE. A Stop hook could refuse to let the worker rest until it writes, and that was
// tried and REMOVED on 2026-07-02 (maintainer's call): the block-until-file-edited nag forced even
// trivial workers into Read/Edit dances that render as noise in the chat UI. This nudges; it never
// blocks.
