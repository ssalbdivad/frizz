// @ts-check
// PermissionRequest hook (frizz worker), matcher "*" — the worker's permission POLICY, and the durable
// structured signal the tailer reads instead of scraping the worker's terminal output.
//
// WHY THIS DECIDES (it used to only observe): a frizz worker runs under a dashboard with nobody at the
// keyboard, so a tool-approval prompt parks the thread invisibly until a human happens to look. frizz
// dispatches Claude workers at `--permission-mode auto` (dispatch.ts WORKER_DISPATCH_PERMISSION), and
// `auto` is NOT non-interactive — its classifier still raises a prompt for anything it deems risky
// (a `git push`, a publish), which is exactly how a worker silently wedges for hours.
//
// The blunt fix would be to dispatch at `bypassPermissions`. This is deliberately NOT that: bypass
// removes the decision POINT, so nothing can ever inspect a request again. (Nearly: bypass became the
// Settings default in 0.7.2, and Claude Code still raises a request there for its bypass-immune safety
// checks — see `bypass-safety-check` below.) Keeping `auto` + deciding
// here preserves the seam — the same request that is auto-approved today can be routed to a policy,
// or to a human, without changing how workers launch. Claude Code labels the outcome in the
// transcript ("Allowed by PermissionRequest hook"), so an auto-approval stays visible rather than
// being indistinguishable from bypass.
//
// THREE OUTCOMES:
//   allow  — auto-approve; the worker proceeds with no prompt.
//   deny   — auto-refuse with a reason the model reads (rides top-level `additionalContext`).
//   defer  — emit NOTHING; the normal prompt is raised and a human answers it. This is the ONLY
//            outcome the tailer treats as a human block (see permMarkerBlocks in tailer.ts).
//
// SCOPE: this plugin loads for EVERY project frizz drives, so the built-in table carries only
// UNIVERSAL rules. Nothing repo-specific belongs here — a rule that is right for one repo (e.g. "never
// open a PR") is wrong for the next.
//
// KNOWN LIMIT — an explicit `ask` RULE outranks this hook (verified 2026-07-25). A project or user
// settings entry like `"permissions": {"ask": ["Bash(git push:*)"]}` raises a prompt that an `allow`
// from here does NOT override: Claude Code says so on the prompt itself ("Ask rule … overrides auto
// mode for this command"). This was isolated against a hook that allows unconditionally — it prompted
// too — so it is Claude Code precedence, not a defect here, and it is arguably the right precedence
// (an explicit human rule should beat a blanket policy). The practical consequence: a repo whose
// settings carry `ask` rules can still park a worker, and the fix for that repo is to relax its own
// rule, not to change this file. Mode-driven asks (the `default`-mode prompt) ARE overridden.
//
// GATE: inert unless FRIZZ_THREAD is set, so a foreign/non-frizz session is never affected.
// FAIL-SAFE: any error at all → emit nothing → the prompt is raised and the human decides. Note this
// inverts the old observer's "fail open": for a hook that can APPROVE, the safe failure is to fall
// back to asking, never to allow.
