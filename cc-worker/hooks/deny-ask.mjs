// PreToolUse hook on AskUserQuestion (frizz-worker). A frizz worker runs under a dashboard, not a
// live chat: an interactive question prompt would hang the session invisibly (nobody is at the
// keyboard to click it). Deny with a redirect to the async pattern: register the question with
// `mcp__frizz__ask` (a row; the free-form ```question fence was retired 2026-09-11), keep working, and
// rest normally; the answer arrives as its own wake.
// GATE: inert unless FRIZZ_THREAD is set. FAIL OPEN on parse errors.
//
// SECOND GATE: also inert when FRIZZ_NATIVE_ASK=1. The premise above — "nobody is at the keyboard" —
// is only true where the question has nowhere to go. On the Claude session-broker path frizz now
// intercepts the call at canUseTool and renders it as a real question card on the dashboard, which the
// operator answers and which returns the chosen labels to the tool. The broker bridge sets that var
// only when an InteractionStore is actually wired to render and resolve the card, so a denial here
// would block a question the operator CAN see. Any other path leaves the var unset, so it keeps the
// deny plus the `mcp__frizz__ask` redirect.
