// SessionStart hook (frizz-worker) — SEEDS a frizz WORKER session's context. Run directly with
// node (zero deps, max Node compat), mirroring cc's hook idiom.
//
// A frizz worker is a top-level interactive `claude` the UI spawns per effort; the slug arrives in
// env FRIZZ_THREAD (and a `THREAD:` line in the first prompt). There are NO thread files, no
// frontmatter, no status field — a worker SIGNALS through its final message (fences), and anything that
// must outlive its context window is an arrangement it makes for itself. This hook injects, on every
// session start (startup/resume/clear/compact):
//   1. `core` — a runtime POINTER, not a copy of the contract: the full worker contract lives ONCE in
//      the system prompt (workerPrompt.ts) the server injects at spawn. This carries only what a
//      static system prompt can't: the runtime scratch-directory PATH, and a one-line pointer.
//   2. the SCRATCH DIRECTORY — `.frizz/threads/<session_id>/`, a folder the worker may use as it likes.
//   3. on `compact` — a short re-grounding (compaction drops the deep model + this orientation).
//
// GATE: everything is gated on FRIZZ_THREAD being set, so the plugin is completely inert when
// loaded outside a frizz worker (e.g. a plain `claude --plugin-dir cc-worker` smoke run).
//
// STALE-INSTALL DEFENSE: the `cc` orchestrator plugin is retired — the marketplace ships only this
// worker plugin, and cc's hooks/skills/agents are gone. But a machine can still carry a CACHED cc
// install from before the retirement, whose hooks fire in every repo gated on cc's opt-IN sentinel.
// A fresh worker never runs `frizz on`, so such a cc is already dormant; we write cc's own per-session
// `off` sentinel anyway via the shared config API (board survives as cc-worker's board
// implementation) so a stale install is guaranteed inert. Cheap belt-and-suspenders. See DECISIONS.md.

// A RUNTIME pointer, NOT a copy of the contract. The full worker contract (signal fences,
// scratch-directory rules, sub-agent rules, the question handback, the stop criterion) lives ONCE in
// the system prompt frizz injects at spawn (workerPrompt.ts / loadWorkerPrompt) — re-applied on every
// resume, and it survives compaction. This hook adds only what a static system prompt CANNOT carry:
// the runtime-derived scratch-directory PATH, plus (below) the compaction re-read nudge and the
// auth-gated gh guidance.
//
// It used to restate the fence protocol, the stop criterion and the autonomy rule in full — ~4.4 KB
// (~1,100 tokens) on every startup, resume, clear AND compact, all of it already in the 42 KB system
// prompt. Trimmed 2026-08-26 (maintainer: "Definitely trim the session seed hook if it's fully
// repetitive") as part of cutting the per-session token overhead Frizz adds over a plain TUI session.

  '⟦frizz worker contract⟧ You are a frizz WORKER driving EXACTLY ONE effort. Your FULL operating contract — the end-of-turn signal fences (```done / ```awaiting — a question is a registered row, `mcp__frizz__ask`, whose card renders at the BOTTOM of your handoff, so every word of explanation goes above it; there is no ```question fence), the scratch-directory rules, the sub-agent rules, the question handback and the stop criterion — lives in your SYSTEM PROMPT; follow it there. ALWAYS SIGN OFF — a fence OR a registration (`ask`, `done`); an open question is one, so rest normally and write no question fence for it. A rest on running work takes the ```awaiting fence with `needs_input: true|false` — `false` is a quiet park and needs no write-up.\n' +

// AUTH-GATED gh guidance — teach the worker to use `gh` well, but ONLY when signed in.
// Shell `gh auth status --active`: exit 0 = an active gh account is authenticated. The whole gate is
// wrapped so it can NEVER throw into SessionStart, and it fails CLOSED — no gh binary, not authed, a
// stall past the timeout, or any other error → we inject NOTHING (guidance is absent, not stale/wrong).
// It re-evaluates on every start/resume/clear/compact, so a later `gh auth login` starts injecting on
// the next turn boundary (and a `gh auth logout` stops it). See DECISIONS.md / plan §8.
