// PostToolUse hook on the `Agent` tool (frizz-worker) — TELL THE WORKER ITS NEW SUB-AGENT'S ADDRESS.
//
// Every sub-agent answers to an address under its thread, `@portTheParser.spelling` (the server's shared
// thread-handle.ts), and the board turns that address into a link that opens the child — in the worker's
// handoff, on its card, anywhere its prose renders. The maintainer asked that agents refer to each other
// "by the fully qualified name so you can easily click to view that agent", never as "another agent".
// The worker prompt says so, and on the first real run the worker still wrote **Spelling** and
// **Version** in its handoff: it had never seen its own thread's handle, and a rule it would have to call
// a tool to apply is one it skips. So the address arrives HERE, as context, the moment the child starts —
// exact, and already in the conversation when the handoff is written.
//
// The server computes it (`subAgentAddressFor`), so the naming rule has one implementation. Found the
// way the frizz MCP server finds it (cc-worker/bin/frizz-mcp.mjs serverLockPort), from what a worker's
// own env carries: FRIZZ_PERM_DIR is `<frizz root>/projects/<project id>/perm-requests`, and the root's
// `server.lock` names the running server.
//
// Only the THREAD's own dispatches: a hook firing inside a sub-agent carries `agent_id`, and that child's
// children sit one segment further down an address this hook does not know.
//
// GATE: inert unless FRIZZ_THREAD is set. FAIL-OPEN ABSOLUTELY: any error, a slow server, a missing lock
// → exit 0 with no output. A missed hint costs one link; a PostToolUse hook must never disturb the turn.
